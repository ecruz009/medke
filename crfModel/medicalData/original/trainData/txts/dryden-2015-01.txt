The tick life cycle for the majority of tick species found in the UK takes on average three years and is made up of three active life stages - the larvae, nymphs and adults. Unlike biting insects, each tick feeds only once per life stage, but each feed takes a number of days. The six-legged larvae feed on average two to six days on small mammals or birds. Once fully engorged, they drop off the host and rest in the vegetation layer on the ground, before moulting to the nymph stage. The nymphs are slightly larger, have eight legs and feed for three to eight days on slightly larger mammalian or avian hosts. Again, once fully engorged, they drop off the host and undergo the moult to the adult stage. The emergent male adults of some species only feed intermittently and do not engorge. The female adults of I. ricinus feed for five to 12 days on larger mammals such as deer and livestock. Following engorgement and mating, the females drop off the host to lay several thousand eggs before dying. In a three-year life cycle, a tick will only spend about three weeks on animals. The processes of blood meal digestion, moulting and egg laying occur over a period of months, during which time, the ticks rest in the vegetation layer. They are sensitive to climatic conditions, particularly temperature and humidity, but dense ground cover vegetation or leaf litter, where the humidity is higher, will prevent the ticks from drying out.
