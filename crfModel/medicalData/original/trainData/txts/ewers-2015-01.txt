While on a 2-week summer camping trip in southern Pennsylvania, a previously healthy 15 year-old boy presented to a nearby emergency department after several days of subjective fever, malaise, and severe left arm radicular pain. He was diagnosed with dehydration, administered intravenous fluids, and discharged. Several days later after returning home his arm pain resolved, but then he developed right-sided neck pain, headache, and difficulty concentrating. One week later, he complained of tinnitus, taste disturbance, otalgia, and subjective hearing loss in his right ear. Three weeks into his illness, the patient presented to a local emergency department for right-sided, upper, and lower facial muscle weakness. He had no previous complaints of erythema chronicum migrans, arthralgias, or arthritis. He was diagnosed with Bellâ€™s Palsy, and serologies for Lyme disease, herpes simplex virus 1 and 2, and Epstein-Barr virus were obtained. His primary care physician prescribed doxy-cycline for a positive Lyme antibody test and referred to the pediatric infectious disease clinic.
