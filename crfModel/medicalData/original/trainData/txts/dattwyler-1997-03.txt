One patient in each treatment group had objective evidence of Lyme disease at the last evaluation (i.e., treatment failed). A patient in the ceftriaxone group who presented with seventh-cranial-nerve palsy and normal results on lumbar puncture continued to have palsy at the three-month follow-up and was given ceftriaxone for an additional five weeks. Despite treatment, the palsy persisted. In a second patient, large-joint arthritis developed during treatment with doxycycline; this patient also had fatigue, joint swelling, limitation of joint movement, arthralgia, and myalgia; he subsequently received intravenous ceftriaxone for three weeks and had a complete resolution of all signs and symptoms.
