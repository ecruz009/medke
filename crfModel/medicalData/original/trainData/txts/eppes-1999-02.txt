Aseptic meningitis, a clinical syndrome of meningeal inflammation in which common bacterial agents cannot be identified in CSF, is associated with a variety of infectious and noninfectious causes. A recent review of 168 adult and pediatric patients with meningitis and a negative Gram stain reported that a definitive cause was established in 23% of patients. [7] Transverse myelitis, malignancy, syphilis, bacteremia, Lyme disease, and viral meningoencephalitis were the most common diagnoses. In children, viral agents, especially Coxsackie and echoviruses, are the most common causes of aseptic meningitis. [8] Lyme disease is the most common vector-borne infection in the United States and children comprise a large proportion of cases. [9] Reported cases of Lyme disease in children exceeded 7 per 100 000 in 1996, [9] but frequencies manyfold higher are reported in endemic areas in the northeastern and north central United States. [10] Because of underreporting of cases, it is likely that the true rates are even higher. [11] The importance and spectrum of Lyme neuroborreliosis in children has been reported in both the United States and Europe, and differences from adult disease have been noted. [12,13]
