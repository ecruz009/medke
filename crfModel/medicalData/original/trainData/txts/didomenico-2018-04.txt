Biofilm production in Borrelia requires the modulation of a complex array of signaling processes which allows spirochetes to communicate with the surrounding environment. The RpoN–RpoS alternative sigma factor and the LuxS quorumsensing pathways, which are involved in several cellular functions in response to environmental stresses (pH and temperature variations, high osmolarity, oxidative stress, high cell density, nutrient starvation, host infection), participate in biofilm production in B. burgdorferi (22, 192). The RpoN–RpoS pathway, also known as the σ^{54}-σ^{S} cascade, regulates adaptive changes in B. burgdorferi during the transition between the tick vector and mammalian host (91, 95). The RpoN–RpoS pathway relies on the activity of RpoN (σ^{54}), which controls the transcription of RpoS (σ^{S}) through the binding to a canonical −24/−12 RpoN-type promoter sequence (95, 193). The activation of the σ^{54}-σ^{S} cascade, in turn, is modulated by a bacterial enhancer-binding protein (bEBP)/σ^{54}-dependent activator (Rrp2) in concert with BosR (91, 95, 193–198). After the activation, RpoS acts as a global gene regulator controlling the expression of over 100 different genes involved in stress responses, host infection and survival, including biofilm formation (87, 95, 182).
