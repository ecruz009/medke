Compared with Lyme disease, the incidence of reported anaplasmosis, Powassan virus disease, and babesiosis is several orders of magnitude lower, and their geographic distribution appears to be similar but more restricted; like the distribution of Lyme disease cases, the geographic range of anaplasmosis and babesiosis has similarly spread over time (Figure 4) [7,19,95,98,99]. Over 96% of Lyme disease cases are reported from just 14 states in the northeast, mid-Atlantic and the upper Midwest [95]. Since the mid-1990s, the number of counties with a high incidence of Lyme disease has increased by approximately 300% [48]. As it is not a notifiable condition, trends in incidence and geographic range of Bo. miyamotoi disease cases are not well characterized, but the geographic range is likely similer to that of Lyme disease [100]. By contrast, ehrlichiosis, caused by E. muris eauclarensis, thus far has been reported only from the upper Midwest [65].
