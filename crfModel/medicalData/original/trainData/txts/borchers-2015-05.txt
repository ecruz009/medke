However, there are some major shortcomings in the currently available data. Determination of the infecting species was based on cultured isolates in many of these studies, but culture of Borrelia spp. is not very sensitive, particularly in CSF samples [104,110,111,397], and even less so in synovial fluid or tissue samples [112,113]. PCR-based amplification of DNA isolated directly from tissue specimens generally shows greater sensitivity [114], but largely depends on the specific PCR target [23,104], still lacks sensitivity, particularly in CSF [104,115,116], and does not necessarily detect Borrelia spp. in all samples that are culture positive [104,108]. Furthermore, since patients with EM are now routinely treated with antibiotics, determination of the infecting species of Borrelia in samples from extracutaneous lesions is likely to yield results that are skewed towards those strains that do not also cause easily recognizable EM lesions. Fewof these studies examined what is likely to be a major determinant of the probability of acquiring an infection with a particular species of Borrelia, namely its prevalence in regional ticks [20,24,111,386,391,398]. The results are somewhat conflicting, most likely because of the small number of ticks and/or human samples examined in some of these investigations. In addition, tick and human samples were collected during different time periods and in different locations, thereby not taking into consideration that there may be considerable temporal and regional variation in the number of infected ticks and the distribution of Borrelia spp. in ticks [20,71,399,400]. Overall, the results suggest that B. garinii may be underrepresented in skin rather than overrepresented in CSF [20,24,386,391]. Note, however, that B. afzelii infection of the nervous system may simply be underrecognized because it does not cause the typical clinical picture of European LNB associated with B. garinii infection, namely radiculoneuritis and/or peripheral facial palsy [110]. Instead, detection of B. afzelii in CSF was associated with mostly nonspecific symptoms, and most of the patients from whose CSF B. afzelii could be cultured did not fulfill the European diagnostic criteria for LNB.
