The fact that LM and VM are both most frequent during the warmer months may lead to confusion in diagnosis and errors in management (ie, failure to provide effective therapy for LM and unnecessary antibiotic treatment for VM). Rapid techniques for diagnosis of VM will facilitate appropriate management, [8] but such technology is not widely available. The diagnosis of LM is most often based on the finding of CSF pleocytosis associated with the occurrence of EM and/or positive serologic tests. However, both enzyme immunoassay and western blot tests for antibody may be negative or indeterminate early in infection when dissemination to the nervous system occurs. [3] Also, delays in performing or reporting these tests may lead to delays that can hinder diagnosis and treatment. More specific techniques for confirming LM include tests for intrathecal production of specific antibody [16,17] and demonstration of Borrelia burgdorferi DNA by polymerase chain reaction. [2,18] However, the polymerase chain reaction test usually is not rapid and is not very sensitive. [2,18]
