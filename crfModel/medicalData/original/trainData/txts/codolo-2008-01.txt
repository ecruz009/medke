Three pathogenic Borrelia species are primarily responsible for Lyme disease, the most common tick-transmitted illness of the boreal hemisphere (1,2). In Europe, Lyme disease is caused by Borrelia burgdorferi, Borrelia afzelii, and Borrelia garinii, whereas in the US, Borrelia burgdorferi is the sole cause (3,4). Lyme disease usually begins with a characteristic expanding skin lesion, erythema migrans (5). After several days or weeks, the spirochete may spread to different sites, causing meningitis, cranial or peripheral neuritis, carditis, atrioventricular node block, or migratory musculoskeletal pain. Months later, Lyme arthritis may develop in untreated patients with Borrelia infection, with a rapid onset of marked swelling and pain of affected joints, most commonly the knee (6). In these patients, synovial fluid contains polymorphonuclear and mononuclear cells (7). In most patients, Lyme arthritis responds to appropriate oral or intravenous antibiotic therapy. However, in rare cases, proliferative synovitis persists after 2 months of treatment with oral antibiotics or 1 month of treatment with intravenous antibiotics, or both. This condition is called antibiotic-refractory Lyme arthritis (3).
