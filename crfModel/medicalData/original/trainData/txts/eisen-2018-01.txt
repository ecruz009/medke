Among the approximately 50 000 locally acquired vector-borne disease cases reported annually from the contiguous United States, roughly 95% are caused by tick-borne pathogens and >70% are Lyme disease [1]. Lyme disease is caused by the spirochetes Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto (herein referred to as B. burgdorferi) [2], or much less commonly by Borrelia mayonii [3]; both are transmitted by the blacklegged tick, Ixodes scapularis (including the junior synonym, Ixodes dammini) in the eastern United States where the vast majority of cases occur [4,5]. Over the past two decades, we have seen expansions in both the geographic range of I. scapularis [6] (Figure 1A,B) and the incidence and geographic range of Lyme disease and other I. scapularis-borne diseases [7,8] (Figure 1C,D). In addition, new I. scapularis-borne human pathogens continue to be discovered. As of 2017, seven microorganisms transmitted by I. scapularis - including five bacteria (Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Bo. burgdorferi, Bo. mayonii, Bo. miyamotoi, and E. muris eauclarensis), one protozoan parasite (Babesia microti), and one virus (Powassan virus) - are known to cause illness in humans [7,9]. The recognition of this diverse guild of I. scapularis-borne pathogens over the last five decades marks a significant shift in the perceived medical importance of the tick; prior to 1970, I. scapularis was not considered an important vector of human pathogens (Figure 2).
