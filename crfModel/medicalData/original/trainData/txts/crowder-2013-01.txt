Respondents were classified as having had personal experience with acute Lyme disease or PTLDS if they or a close associate had the disease (Table 3). Three groups were formed from this information: those with no personal experience with Lyme disease or PTLDS; those with personal experience with Lyme disease, but not PTLDS; and those with personal experience with PTLDS with or without personal experience with Lyme disease. All groups agree that PTLDS can be severe and chronic condition that can last for many years. Less than 5% in any of the groups think that PTLDS is either easy to treat or resolves on its own. The uncertainty ratings for these questions were particularly interesting to see. In general, uncertainty was high in the groups with no experience with PTLDS. Uncertainty regarding the severity and chronic nature of PTLDS was higher in those with no experience with either disease (34%) and those with experience with Lyme disease, but not PTLDS (30%) compared with those faculty members with experience with PTLDS (9%). A similar pattern was seen for the question of ease of treatment and resolution of disease (Table 3). Respondents were asked to give their opinion regarding the aetiology of PTLDS. The most frequently chosen answer was ‘an ongoing host inflammatory response triggered by previous Lyme disease but not due to persistent infection,  regardless of group. In contrast, a large minority, as high as 39% of respondents with a personal experience with PTLDS, selected ‘continued infection’ as a potential aetiology of PTLDS.
