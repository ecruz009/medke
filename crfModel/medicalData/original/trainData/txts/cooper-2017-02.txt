Bilateral lower motor neurone facial weakness and mononeuritis multiplex ring alarm bells for Lyme disease, but unilateral lower motor neurone facial weakness does not necessarily. It is important, therefore, to consider the clues to the different diagnoses. Bell’s palsy typically presents with an acute onset to a maximum within 72 hours. [11] About 50% of patients have a mild-tomoderate post-auricular pain (25% before the weakness, 50% contemporaneous with the weakness, and 25% after the weakness), with altered taste in 35%.11 In 30% a dry eye is noticed, and in 20% a dry mouth, due to parasympathetic involvement. [11] Patients with Lyme disease with facial palsy may have noticed a tick bite - a hard-bodied tick attachment with or without engorgement is particularly relevant. [9] And 90% will experience a transient rash, erythema migrans, 2–40 days after exposure. [9] Approximately 7% will feel generally unwell, and arthralgia has also been reported. [3,9,12] Although the diagnosis is clinical, serological testing may be useful, particularly paired blood samples taken at a 4-week interval, to allow for seroconversion. [9]
