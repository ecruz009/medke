The expression of different proteins, including OspC, ErpP, ErpA, ErpC, and enolase is required to readily immobilize host plasminogen on spirochetal surface, facilitating efficient dissemination (116–118). Plasminogen is a glycoprotein produced by the liver and abundant in the plasma and in certain tissues (119). Conversion of plasminogen to active plasmin is promoted by proteolytic activation induced by either tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) and/or urokinase-type plasminogen activator urokinase (uPA). Plasmin is responsible for intravascular fibrinolysis and contributes to numerous physiological and pathological processes, including tissue remodeling, cell migration, thrombolysis, wound healing, and cancer progression (120, 121). Invasive forms of B. burgdorferi are known to expresses multiple plasminogen-binding surface proteins that likely assist pathogen dissemination through host tissues (120, 122). Enolase is an integral enzyme of the glycolysis and gluconeogenesis pathways, and a multifunctional protein found in both prokaryote and eukaryotes (123). In eukaryotic cells, surface enolase acts as a plasminogen receptor in certain tumor cells (123, 124). Similarly, this enzyme is also localized on the cell surface of different microorganisms including B. burgdorferi (118, 125–127). The surface-localized enolase acts as a plasminogen receptor contributing to spirochetal survival in feeding ticks (118). Although dispensable for infection, plasminogen is required for dissemination in ticks, and its absence is associated with a decreased spirochetemia in plasminogen-deficient mice (128). Surface-associated plasmin on B. burgdorferi degrade fibronectin, which is an important component of the ECM, laminin and vitronectin (129, 130). B. burgdorferi also induces the release of host matrix metalloproteases 9 (MMP-9) and MMP-1, and plasmin-coated B. burgdorferi activates pro-MMP-9, leading to degradation of basement membranes (131).
