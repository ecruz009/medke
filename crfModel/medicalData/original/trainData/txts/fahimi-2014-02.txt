The unique linkage number was used to link subjects from the index ED visit to subsequent ED encounters or hospitalizations within 90 days. Our primary outcome was a composite of the following serious ED or inpatient discharge diagnoses (by ICD-9  code) within 90 days of the index ED Bell’s palsy diagnosis: ischemic stroke (433.01, 433.11, 433.21, 433.31, 433.81, 433.91, 434.01, 434.11, 434.91, and 436), combined with an algorithm previously validated for identifying acute ischemic stroke (11), intracranial hemorrhage (431), or subarachnoid hemorrhage (430); brain tumor (191); central nervous system infection, including meningitis, encephalitis, and brain abscess (320-326); HIV (042); Guillain-Barré syndrome (357.0); Lyme disease (088.81); otitis media or mastoiditis (381-383); or herpes zoster (053). These diagnoses were chosen a priori to represent distinct and clinically important disease entities that may present in a similar fashion to Bell’s palsy. We excluded some common mimics from our outcomes (eg, diabetic neuropathy, sarcoidosis) because, although they may initially be confused with Bell’s palsy, the clinical significance of misdiagnosis is unclear and patient outcomes would generally not be expected to worsen from delayed diagnosis. Additionally, we excluded mortality as a separate outcome because any death related to one of the outcome diagnoses would already be captured.
