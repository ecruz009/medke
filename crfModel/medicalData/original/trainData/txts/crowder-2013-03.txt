More than 90% of faculty respondents from both Lyme endemic and non-endemic regions agree that Lyme disease is common in certain regions of the US. Most faculty members (88%) agree that the geographical range of Lyme disease will increase in the future. The majority do not have professional experience, defined as having been taught about, cared for patients with, or done research on, Lyme disease (66%) or PTLDS (83%). While many are unsure of the research funding environment for Lyme disease and PTLDS (82%), 17% believe that these diseases are underfunded. Likewise, 85% of surveyed faculty members believe that more public health education is needed surrounding Lyme disease and PTLDS. Pvalues indicating statistically significant differences between the Lyme endemic and non-Lyme endemic groups for these analyses are shown at the bottom of Table 2.
