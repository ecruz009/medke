Avoidance of tick bites is the most obvious means to prevent B burgdorferi infection. If people must be outside in areas where Ixodes ticks are found, they are advised to wear protective clothing and tick repellent containing N,N-di-ethyl-m-toluamide (DEET). Frequent skin inspection and prompt removal of ticks should also decrease the risk of infection. However, data regarding the efficacy of these measures are limited. Other measures, including burning or removal of vegetation in tick-harboring areas, use of acaricides, and control of the deer population, result in up to a 94% decrease in the population of I scapularis ticks. Studies show that, despite warnings, only 40% to 50% of adults take precautions against tick bites even when they are aware of Lyme disease. Immediate removal of attached ticks can help prevent Lyme disease infection. Therefore, complete inspection of the skin and scalp, particularly for children, is recommended after spending time outside in endemic areas.
