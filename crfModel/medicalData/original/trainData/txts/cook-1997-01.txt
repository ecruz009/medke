The constitutional “flu-like” symptoms that frequently accompany early stage LD may also act as a guide to the etiology of FNP. Fever and headache are the most frequent symptoms associated with LD. [13,20] Facial nerve palsy will typically manifest itself early in LD and has been noted to arise during or even after treatment has been initiated. [16] In children, EM frequently occurs on the head and neck region. This is in contradistinction to adults who typically develop EM on the lower extremities. This likely results from a child’s shorter stature. That subsequent FNP arises on the ipsilateral side suggests direct neural invasion, although there is no histopathologic evidence for this. [10] Additionally, FNP is one of the more common neurologic manifestations of LD, especially in children. [10,13,16,17] Children also manifest bilateral FNP more frequently than adults. Bilateral FNP is more frequently caused by LD than other causes.
