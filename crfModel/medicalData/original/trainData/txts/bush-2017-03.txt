Microbiologic isolation of a pathogen remains the ‘gold standard’ in infectious diseases diagnosis. However, some etiologic agents, for example Treponema pallidum (the causative agent of syphilis), cannot be cultivated on artificial medium leaving diagnosis to rely on the direct detection of the pathogen in patient specimens and/or reactivity in serologic tests. Advances in molecular medicine, particularly PCR assays designed to detect even minute quantities of organism-specific nucleic acid, have greatly enhanced the laboratory’s ability to make a specific diagnosis of an infectious disease. B. burgdorferi can be isolated in-vitro from EM skin tissue, blood samples, and on occasions from cerebrospinal (meningitis cases) and joint fluids. However, this requires incubation on specialized Barbour–Stoenner–Kelly (BSK) medium, has a low yield, and generally is not performed in most clinical microbiology laboratories. [65] Moreover, routine hematologic, metabolic, and liver profile tests are usually unremarkable and offer limited diagnostic utility in confirming Lyme disease.
