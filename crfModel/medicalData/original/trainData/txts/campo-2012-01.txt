The following day, the patient was evaluated by a neurosurgeon, who noted that the right bicep and brachioradial reflexes were absent which was a variation from the initial presentation in the ED. The neurosurgeon recommended further testing including a myelogram and lumbar puncture to assess the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) due to the patient’s symptomatology. The patient was placed on dexamethasone (Decadron) 4 mg every 6 hr intravenously and the outpatient medications were also continued. A lumbar puncture (LP) was performed and CSF samples were sent to the lab. Results were positive for elevated glucose, white blood cells, and protein levels. The CSF was also positive for Lyme (Table 2). An infectious disease consult was ordered and the patient was seen that day. The infectious disease physician obtained further history of a rash on the right chest wall that developed prior to the patient’s symptoms. The patient did not recall seeing a tick at the site of the rash. The physician noted a slight left facial droop and an erythematous area to the right chest wall lateral to the breast. According to the physician, the lesion was not consistent with erythema migrans at the time of the examination. The physician ordered a repeat LP to further evaluate the CSF (Table 2). Further Lyme studies were ordered and obtained and the results are shown in Table 3.
