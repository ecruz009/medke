Bo. burgdorferi and Ba. microti share a common reservoir, the white-footed mouse, explaining the increased likelihood of finding coinfections more often than expected by chance [85,86,91]. Recent evidence suggests that Bo. burgdorferi promotes transmission of Ba. microti, and the former typically becomes established in new foci before the latter [85,86,91,92]. By contrast, coinfection with Bo. burgdorferi and A. phagocytophilum are typically observed at rates expected based on prevalence of each infection individually, suggesting independent enzootic transmission maintenance cycles [83,84,87,93]. Although, the efficiency of I. scapularis to transmit Bo. burgdorferi or A. phagocytophilum is not affected by coinfection [84], coinfection in mice has been shown to increase pathogen acquisition by feeding larvae, compared with rates observed when feeding on singly infected mice [94]. The relative abundance of various hosts in a community likely influences the probability of coinfections occurring. Although reported less commonly as a coinfection with Bo. burgdorferi compared with A. phagocytophilum or Ba. microti, coinfection with Bo. miyamotoi appears to occur at rates expected by chance, or lower, again suggesting independent mechanisms of persistence [76,82].
