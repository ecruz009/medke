Tick surveillance is not standardized or routine, thus hampering our ability to monitor changes in the distribution and abundance of I. scapularis [6,30]. Retrospective review of I. scapularis records reveals remarkable range expansion over the past century, particularly in the northern portion of the eastern United States. The earliest record of the tick in the northeast dates back to the 1920s near Cape Cod, Massachusetts [31]. By 1945, I. scapularis was recorded sporadically from states along the northern Atlantic coast, but its core distribution was primarily in the Gulf Coast states and the southeast [10]. In the early 1960s, focal populations were reported along the New England coast and in Rhode Island, and later in that decade records emerged from Long Island, New York, and northwestern Wisconsin. During the 1970s, the reported distribution of the tick expanded, and its abundance increased along the Atlantic coast from New England to the mid-Atlantic states; expansion inland continued through the 1980s and 1990s [30,31].
