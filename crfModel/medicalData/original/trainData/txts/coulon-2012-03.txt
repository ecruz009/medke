Previous authors have documented that Lyme disease affects the shoulder joint, [5,8] and the avascular articular surface of the distal supraspinatus tendon [28] is a favorable location for the spirochetes due to the somewhat hypoxic condition of the area. It appears that the patientâ€™s distal supraspinatus tendinopathy, with consequent pain and inflammation, was a symptom of Lyme disease and the associated spirochete load and secondarily caused supraspinatus impingement. Several symptoms displayed during treatment demonstrated to the physical therapist that an underlying condition such as Lyme disease was involved.
