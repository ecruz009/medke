The I. scapularis tick is capable of transmitting seven known human pathogens. In order of decreasing frequency of reported cases, three of them, B. burgdorferi, Anaplasma phagocytophilium, and Babesia microti have accounted for the majority of related infections in recent years. [68] An accurate determination of the rate of Lyme disease coinfection with either of these has proven inconclusive but appears to be an uncommon event. Human granulocytic anaplasmosis (formerly ehrlichosis) caused by A. phagocytophilium typically produces leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and mild elevation of hepatic amino-transaminases, which when encountered in Lyme disease should prompt the consideration of coinfection with this rickettsial organism. [85] The parasitic protozoa B. microti is also carried by I. scapularis in the Northeast and upper Midwest sections of the United States. Infection may also be transmitted by transfusion of infected blood or from an infected mother to her fetus in a vertical fashion. [86] Important clues that should raise the possibility of coinfection with this red blood cell pathogen are a more severe presentation of disease, hemolytic anemia and low platelet counts, and the observance of the classic "maltese cross" arrangement of organisms within infected erythrocytes. Patients with functional or anatomic asplenia are known to suffer the harshest infections. [87]
