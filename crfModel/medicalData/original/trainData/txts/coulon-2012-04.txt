In conclusion, many overhead athletes lead very active lifestyles and spend time in the outdoors, which may increase their chances of contracting Lyme disease. Lyme disease is best diagnosed clinically, as no currently available test, no matter the source or type, is definitive in detecting an infection with this pathogen. [3,6,11,19] The entire clinical picture must be taken into account, [3] and as physical therapists, we spend a larger portion of time with our patients than other health care professionals and may be best positioned to recognize the signs or symptoms of atypical musculoskeletal conditions before other health care providers. Because there has been an upward trend in diagnosed cases of Lyme disease, [9] it is important for physical therapists to recognize the symptoms of Lyme disease and to reach the appropriate clinical diagnosis with all patients (Fig. 3). It also is important for physical therapists and physicians to have collaborative relationships through which the patient will receive high-quality care.
