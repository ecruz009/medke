Conclusions from this study are mixed. At the primary efficacy end point of week 12, IV ceftriaxone treatment resulted in greater improvement in cognition and, among the more impaired, in physical functioning, pain, and fatigue. Clinical significance, however, depends on long-term effects. Notable were the long-term benefits for the ceftriaxone group on physical functioning and pain among the more severely affected patients at baseline, because these are among the most troubling aspects of posttreatment Lyme disease. [28] However, our primary interest in this study was on cognition, for which the improvement was not sustained to week 24. Further, adverse effects attributed to IV ceftriaxone occurred in 26% of patients. Therefore, considering both the limited duration of cognitive improvement and the risks, 10 weeks of IV ceftriaxone and then 14 weeks of no antibiotic is not an effective strategy for sustained cognitive improvement. Although certain subgroups (patients with more joint or neurologic abnormalities) may experience long-term benefit from ceftriaxone, the predictor analyses were exploratory rather than hypothesis driven, and they require independent confirmation. Pending such confirmation, treatment strategies that are safer and more durable are needed.
