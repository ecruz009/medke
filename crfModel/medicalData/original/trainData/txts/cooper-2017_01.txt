Cases of Lyme disease have been rising steadily over recent years, as have diagnoses in combination with Bell’s palsy (Table 1). This may be due to better surveillance, increased awareness of the disease, or increasing infection rates caused by travel to endemic areas. [1] Classically, Lyme disease is associated with areas of woodland, pasture, and heath, where ticks parasitise small mammals such as field mice and voles, and larger animals such as sheep, deer, and horses. [3] The majority of European cases are within the UK, including forested areas such as the New Forest, Exmoor, the South Downs, Thetford Forest in East Anglia, the Lake District, the Yorkshire Moors, and the Scottish Highlands, although there are also cases in the Dordogne and Eastern Europe. [1] The maps provided in Figures 2–4 support this finding and add to them (for example, one of the highest areas in England was found in the north west of London in the Chiltern Hills).
