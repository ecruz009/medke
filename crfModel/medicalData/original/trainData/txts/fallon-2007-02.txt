Efficacy analyses were performed using all randomized participants, the intent-to-treat (ITT) sample. Lyme patient and healthy controls were compared with respect to demographic and baseline clinical characteristics, using t tests for continuous measures and χ^2 tests for categorical measures.
Tests and estimates of differences between groups (IV antibiotic, IV placebo, and healthy controls) with respect to the multivariate measure of cognition (six domains: motor, psychomotor, working memory, attention, verbal fluency, and  memory) over time (baseline, week 12, and week 24) were based on longitudinal mixed-effects models (LMM), [23] which account for the correlation between the domains and between the repeated observations over time. [24] The LMM included main effects and all interaction terms. Time was modeled as a nominal factor rather than a continuous variable.
Including all two- and three-way interactions, the model for the covariance structure was selected based on maximizing Bayesian information criteria. [25,26] Keeping the model for the covariance as selected, stepwise backward elimination was used to select the “best” model for the mean structure. Inference regarding the comparison between the groups was based on the best model. Significant omnibus tests for ITT differences among the three groups over time (two-sided α=0.05) were followed by pairwise comparisons; the p values for these post hoc tests are reported unadjusted.
