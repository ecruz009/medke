Bacterial meningitis clinical prediction rules identify children with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis who are at very low risk of bacterial meningitis. [1–6] However, in Lyme disease–endemic areas, such as the northeastern and mid-Atlantic states, children with CSF pleocytosis who are at low risk of bacterial meningitis may still have Lyme meningitis, which is treated with 3 to 4 weeks of parenteral antibiotics. [7,8] Because it takes several days to obtain Borrelia burgdorferi serology results, clinicians must decide whether to hospitalize and to start empirical antibiotics for children being evaluated for Lyme meningitis.
