The patient had a history of diffuse large non-Hodgkinâ€™s B cell CNS lymphoma. This had been diagnosed 10 years before admission and treated with chemotherapeutic doses of methotrexate (MTX), and was followed by maintenance MTX infusions. She had achieved a complete remission for 4 years on this regimen. Six years before admission, the patient had experienced a recurrence of her CNS lymphoma, manifested by cognitive changes and accompanied by radiologic evidence of new lesions on a brain MRI scan.  She resumed therapy with MTX, which continued through 2004. In 2005, she developed new brain lesions that were treated with the combination of high-dose MTX, rituximab, and temozolomide. This regimen induced another complete remission, but she experienced a third recurrence in 2006, at which time she was treated with myeloablative chemotherapy consisting of cytarabine (Ara-C)/etoposide (VP-16), followed by autologous bone marrow rescue. Following her bone marrow transplant, she had remained in remission until the time of the current presentation. Aside from her oncologic history, the only other past medical history of note was a caesarean section delivery performed in early 2002, followed by a hysterectomy for placenta previa.
