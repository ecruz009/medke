Patients who had been in areas where Lyme disease is endemic, who were eight years of age or older, and who had acute disseminated Lyme borreliosis were eligible for enrollment in this openlabel, controlled, randomized, multicenter study. The study was conducted between May 1990 and June 1994. Erythema migrans, defined as an expanding, annular, erythematous skin lesion at least 5 cm in diameter, was required for study entry. Disseminated disease was considered present if the patient had one or more of the following: more than one erythema migrans lesion; carditis manifested by heart block; neurologic abnormalities (seventh-cranial-nerve palsy or radiculitis of less than three monthsâ€™ duration); and acute large-joint arthritis.
We excluded pregnant or nursing women and patients with evidence of syphilis, meningitis, or collagen vascular disease; current symptoms of Lyme disease for which they had previously received treatment; a serious underlying disease that precluded the evaluation of the response to treatment; gallbladder disease; or hypersensitivity to ceftriaxone or doxycycline. Patients treated with antimicrobial agents effective in Lyme disease within 48 hours before study entry or treated with an investigational compound within two weeks before study entry were also excluded, as were patients with meningitis or encephalitis.
