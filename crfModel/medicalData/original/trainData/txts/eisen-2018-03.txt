Lyme disease was first recognized in the United States as a new form of inflammatory arthritis in 1975 [52]. In 1982, a spirochete, later namedBo. burgdorferi [53], was identified as the etiological agent and shown to be transmissible by I. scapularis [2,5]. Although numerous small mammals and birds have been implicated as reservoirs of Bo. burgdorferi, the white-footed mouse is among the most important reservoirs in the eastern United States [15,36,54,55].
Human granulocytic anaplasmosis, originally described as human granulocytic ehrlichiosis (Ehrlichia phagocytophila), was first identified in six patients from northern Minnesota and Wisconsin presenting with acute febrile illnesses between 1990 and 1993. The timing of onset of cases was consistent with host-seeking activity of I. scapularis and Dermacentor variabilis and the former was implicated as a vector based on evidence that the closely related Ixodes ricinus transmits E. phagocytophila in Europe [56]. In 1996, I. scapularis was experimentally confirmed as a vector of E. phagocytophila, and P. leucopus was shown to be a competent reservoir [57]. In 2001, this intraleukocytic bacterium was renamed A. phagocytophilum [58].
