Lyme carditis is estimated to occur in 4 –10% of untreated patients with Lyme disease in the US (17,18). It occurs most often during stage 2 of the B burgdorferi infection, the early disseminated stage, accompanied by neurologic symptoms and musculoskeletal symptoms. The early disseminated stage usually develops weeks to months after the appearance of an erythema migrans lesion (14). Our patient indicated that she had an erythematous rash on her thigh several months before these symptoms, and this most likely represented an erythema migrans lesion. The principal manifestation of Lyme carditis is a self-limited conduction defect, usually consisting of variable degrees of AV conduction delay. Carditis can lead to lightheadedness, syncope, dyspnea, palpitations, and chest pain, but it can also be asymptomatic, a fact that probably contributes to an underestimation of this complication’s true prevalence. B burgdorferi infections have also been reported to cause pericarditis, endocarditis, myocarditis, pericardial effusion, myocardial infarction, coronary artery aneurysm, prolonged QT interval, and congestive heart failure. The conduction abnormalities are generally limited, with CHB resolving by an average of one week and lesser degrees of block by one month. Temporary pacemakers are required in a minority of cases. The need for permanent pacing despite antibiotics is quite rare.
