PCR products were analyzed by ethidium bromide staining of agarose gels and confirmed by Southern blot hybridization, performed as described previously with nested probes. [11] Briefly, 30 to 50 pl from each PCR-amplified fraction was applied to 1.5% agarose gel and electrophoresis performed at 100 V for 3 to 4 hours. Gels were then rinsed in deionized water, denatured in 1.0 mmol/L NaCl, 0.5 mol/L NaOH twice for 15 minutes, and then neutralized by soaking in 0.5 mol/L TRIS (pH 7.4)/1.5 mol/L NaCl twice for 15 minutes. Gels were then transferred into a nylon membrane by capillary blotting and baked for 2 hours at 80” C in a vacuum oven. Filters were then prehybridized at 42” C for 3 to 6 hours in a solution of 5x saline-sodium citrate (SSC) (1 x SSC = 0.15 mol/L NaCl and 0.015 mol/L sodium citrate pH 7.4), 50 mmolIL sodium phosphate pH 7.0, 0.1% sodium pyrophosphate, 10X Denhardt’s solution (0.2% bovine serum albumin, Ficoll, and polyvinyl pyrrolidone), and 100 ug/rnl denatured herring sperm DNA, and then hybridized at 37” C in a fresh solution containing a phosphorus 32 end-labeled oligonucleotide probe for 20 to 25 hours9, l2 Blots were washed in 2X SSC, 0.5% SDS twice for 15 minutes at room temperature, then in 0.1% SSC, 0.5% SDS four times for 15 minutes at 40” C, and finally in 0.1% SSC twice for 15 minutes at 40” C. Filters were then exposed to Kodax X-AR fiti (Eastman Kodak, Rochester, N.Y.) with a Comex Lighting Plus intensifying screen @u Pont, Boston, Mass.) at -70” C for 1 to 3 days.
