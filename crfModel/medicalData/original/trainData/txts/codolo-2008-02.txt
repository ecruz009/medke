NapA was cloned, expressed, and purified from Bacillus subtilis. The NapA gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from B burgdorferi strain B31, using standard methods. The following primers were used: 5-CCCGAGCTCATAAAGGAGATAG-TTATG-3' and 5-CCCAAGCTTCTATTTTGCATCACA-CTC-3' (underlining indicates Sac I and Hind III restriction enzyme sites, respectively). The amplified fragment was digested and inserted into the expression vector pSM214G, resulting in plasmid pSM214G-NapA. B subtilis strain SMS 118 containing the plasmid pSM214G-NapA was grown for 15 hours in YT medium and 15 Î¼g/ml of chloramphenicol. After centrifugation, cells were resuspended in 30 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.8, and lysed through 3 French press passages. Debris was removed by centrifugation, and ammonium sulfate 60% was added to the supernatant.
