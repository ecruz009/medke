Early disseminated infection typically occurs within a few days to weeks after contact with the infected tick. Signs include multiple (secondary) erythema migrans lesions. Additionally, musculoskeletal, neurologic, or cardiovascular symptoms can occur. Musculoskeletal symptoms (present in 60% of those infected) include migratory joint or muscle pain, with or without joint swelling. Neurologic manifestations (present in 15% of cases) may include meningitis, paralysis of the facial cranial nerve, and radicular neuropathies. Cardiovascular symptoms are less common (present in 8% of those infected) but may include temporary atrioventricular blocks of varying degree. Although temporary pacing may be necessary in more than 30% of patients with cardiac involvement, complete heart block rarely develops. [15] Untreated or inadequately treated Lyme disease may progress to late disseminated disease within weeks to months after initial infection.
