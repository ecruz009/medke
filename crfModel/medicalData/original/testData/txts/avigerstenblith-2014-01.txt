Neuroimaging findings are typically unremarkable in Lyme disease. Single-photon emission computed tomography scans are more likely to show abnormalities (often with multifocal areas of decreased perfusion in the cortex and subcortical white matter) than magnetic resonance imaging scans are, but single-photon emission computed tomography scans offer little positive or negative predictive value in the diagnosis. [18â€“20] MRT 2-weighted imaging in some cases can reveal white matter lesions, enlarged ventricles, and cortical atrophy; however, these results are nonspecific, and the spirochete does not appear to preferentially settle in certain brain territories (as it does in herpes simplex virus infection). Neuropsychologic testing sometimes confirms objective (often nonspecific) impairments, as is the case with other infectious diseases. [19,21] Electroencephalograms typically lack abnormal findings, except in cases of Lyme disease that present with encephalitis. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis for Lyme antibodies is not necessary for the diagnosis of Lyme disease even when the nervous system is affected. [22] However, it can be helpful to exclude other, more dangerous, pathogens. It is rare to have CSF antibodies without serologic ones, so the absence of serologic antibodies indicates that Lyme disease is not present. Likewise, a negative result on CSF antibody test does not exclude central nervous system Lyme disease and a positive CSF antibody test does not establish the presence of Lyme disease (as antibodies can diffuse from the serum to the CSF).
