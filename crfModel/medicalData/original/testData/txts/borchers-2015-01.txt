Spirochetes with similar morphology, protein profile and antigenic determinants were detected in Ixodes ricinus ticks from Switzerland and Ixodes pacificus ticks from Oregon [7,16] and subsequently in Ixodes persulcatus ticks in Russia [17]. Genotyping subsequently established that Lyme disease in Europe was caused not only by Bb sensu stricto, but also by two genotypically distinct species, which were named Borrelia afzelii and Borrelia garinii and subsumed under the B. burgdorferi sensu lato complex (here Borrelia species abbreviated as Borrelia spp.), which now contains at least 20 confirmed or proposed genomic species (see Table 1). Of these, Borrelia spielmanii, Borrelia bavariensis, Borrelia bissettii, Borrelia lusitaniae, Borrelia americana, Borrelia andersonii and Borrelia valaisiana also have pathogenic potential (see Table 1 for the available evidence). Of particular note, it had long been held that Bb is the only species causing Lyme disease in the US, but PCR-based detection of both B. americana and B. andersonii has been reported in blood or skin of a number of US patients, some of them with EM and/or other manifestations of Lyme disease [18,19]. In addition, B. bissettii, which has been isolated from the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) of a European patient with Lyme disease [20], has also been detected by PCR in serum of three Californian subjects, but details on whether this was associated with any disease manifestations are not available [21]. It should be kept in mind, however, that detection by PCR or even isolation by culture of a particular species of Borrelia does not prove its pathogenicity since it is not uncommon for patients to simultaneously harbor two or more species [22e25]. While direct PCR of tissue samples appears to be more sensitive than culture-based typing, it does not reliably amplify all strains identified by culture [26].
