In contrast to post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome, chronic Lyme disease is a controversial term that causes considerable confusion owing to lack of a standardized case definition, with some even questioning its existence. Ingeneral, it refers to individuals who attribute bodily symptoms to a persistent Lyme infection, irrespective of whether theyhave a history of Lyme disease. Multiple patient advocacy groups that have encouraged patients (many of whom had negative results on serologic testing) to think that they have chronic infections have flourished. [32] This may prevent some individuals from seeking a second opinion that may reveal another disorder. Some groups have created their own guide lines for the management of chronic Lyme disease. Others contend that physicians lack sufficient knowledge about Lyme disease (and are underdiagnosing it) and that assays used to make the diagnosis are not credible.
