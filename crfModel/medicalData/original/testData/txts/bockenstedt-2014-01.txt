Arthritis is the most common late manifestation of Lyme disease and in one study (7) was documented to occur in 60% of patients in whom infection was not treated at earlier stages, usually developing many months (average 6 months) after infection. Most patients present with an oligoarticular inflammatory arthritis affecting 1 or more large joints, especially the knee [7] (Table 2). The arthritis can be migratory, but involvement of 5 joints is unusual. Other signs may include bursitis or tendinitis and temporomandibular joint pain. Children often present with more acute arthritis than adults, with fever and elevated peripheral blood and SF white blood cell counts, suggesting septic arthritis [10,11]. Alternatively, patients with Lyme arthritis may have no other symptoms of systemic infection and present with a large joint effusion with more stiffness than pain. Baker’s cysts can form and rupture.
Without antibiotic treatment, Lyme arthritis may wax and wane, with an episode of synovitis lasting weeks to months; episodes can decrease in frequency and resolve over time [7]. A minority (10%) of patients develop synovitis of a joint that persists despite multiple courses of antibiotics, an entity termed “antibiotic-refractory Lyme arthritis” [7]. The genetics of both the host (12,13) and the strain of B burgdorferi causing the infection (14) appear to play a role in determining this outcome, which shares features with other forms of nonseptic inflammatory arthritis (Table 2).
