Arthritis is a late manifestation of Lyme disease, usually beginning months after the tick bite. However, a history of erythema migrans or tick bite may be lacking. Patients have intermittent or persistent attacks of joint swelling and pain, primarily in one or a few large joints, often the knee, during a period of months to several years, with few systemic manifestations. The diagnosis is established by two-tier serologic testing for B. burgdorferi by ELISA and IgG Western blotting, which typically shows strong responses to many spirochetal proteins with many bands present. PCR testing of synovial fluid for B. burgdorferi DNA is often positive prior to antibiotic therapy, but the test is not a reliable indicator of spirochetal eradication following antibiotic treatment, since spirochetal DNA may persist after spirochetal killing. Initial recommended therapies include a 30-day course of oral doxycycline or amoxicillin. However, for patients with persistent joint swelling despite oral therapy, IV ceftriaxone for 2 to 4 weeks may be needed for successful treatment. A small percentage of patients may have persistent arthritis for months or several years after both oral and IV antibiotic therapy, which may be treated successfully with anti-inflammatory agents, DMARDs, or synovectomy. The antibody response to B. burgdorferi declines slowly after treatment, but the test typically remains positive for years after therapy.
