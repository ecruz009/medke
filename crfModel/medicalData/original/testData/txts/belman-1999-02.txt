Facial nerve palsy. Facial nerve palsy (FNP), the most frequent neurological complication in children [37,43,53,54,57,61,64,75,76] can be the presenting manifestation of Lyme disease. In large series, about one third of patients with Lyme disease-associated FNP report antecedent EM. When a tick bite is recalled or EM occurs on the face or neck, FNP usually affects the same side. Bilateral involvement is common, involving 6% to 37% of patients. [19,53,55-57,75-79] Lyme disease-associated FNP displays a distinct seasonal pattern, from May to November, with peak incidence in the summer months.
European studies indicate that Lyme neuroborreliosis is the most common cause of FNP in children who live in endemic areas. [14,15,54,59,75,76] Overall, more than one third (34% to 43%) of children with FNP were found to have neuroborreliosis as indicated by detection of CSF Bb-specific IgM antibodies. [54,59,75.76] Prospective studies also reveal that the percentage rises to more than 50% during the summer months. [59,76] This contrasts with adult studies in which the relative frequency of Lyme disease-associated FNP is estimated to be 20% to 25%). [14,80]
