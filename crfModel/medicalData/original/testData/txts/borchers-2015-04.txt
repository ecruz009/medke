The manifestations of Lyme disease are routinely treated with antibiotics; therapy hastens the resolution and largely prevents the development of other disease manifestations. The classes of antibiotics that have shown the greatest effectiveness against Borrelia spirochetes is b-lactams (in particular cephalosporins) tetracyclines and, to a lesser extent, macrolides. The best treatment approach, in particular the duration of therapy, is a matter of ongoing debate. It is quite evident that not all patients, and most certainly not all species or strains of Borrelia [113] respond equally to the antibiotics most commonly used in the treatment of Lyme disease. Based on the available evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs), treatment recommendations have been published by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) [221], the American Academy of Pediatrics [271], and by a variety of national and supranational associations in Europe [203,272] (www.eucalb.com). As the comparison between the guidelines published by the IDSA and the EUCALB in Table 4 illustrates, the approaches to therapy are largely similar on both sides of the Atlantic, but there are some minor differences in the recommended dosage and treatment duration. Note that the International Lyme and Associated Diseases Society has also published guidelines for the management of Lyme disease [273]. These advocate more aggressive and longer treatment courses for patients with persistent symptoms or refractory disease, but much of the terminology is poorly defined and the cited “evidence” is largely restricted to older studies that support such an approach and ignores much of the other available evidence. The results of several RCTs and a large retrospective study do not show any benefit in extending the duration of treatment with doxycycline from 10 days to 15 or 20 days in patients with EM [274-276]. Retrospectively obtained data suggest a similar conclusion for amoxicillin [276]. In another double-blind RCT, treatment of patients with disseminated Lyme borreliosis with a 3-week course of i.v. ceftriaxone followed by 100 days of amoxicillin did not improve the outcome compared to a 3-week course of ceftriaxone alone [277]. These findings do not exclude that some patients may benefit from longer or more aggressive therapy, but the risk-benefit ratio has to be carefully weighed for each individual patient.
