In addition to serologic testing, clinical features may distinguish Lyme arthritis from other arthritides. A common concern is mechanical injury in an active individual, and therefore, orthopedists are often the first specialist to see a patient with Lyme arthritis. However, the clinical picture of Lyme arthritis is most like reactive arthritis in adults or pauciarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis in children, and serologic testing is essential to distinguish Lyme arthritis from these entities. Children may have a more acute presentation, with higher synovial WBC counts which may suggest a diagnosis of acute septic arthritis. [22-24] However, Lyme arthritis typically causes only minimal pain with passive range of motion, and involvement of more than one joint (currently or by history) may help to distinguish Lyme arthritis from septic bacterial arthritis. [22-24] Lyme arthritis rarely, if ever, causes chronic, symmetrical polyarthritis, which helps to distinguish Lyme arthritis from rheumatoid arthritis. Fibromyalgia is sometimes misdiagnosed as Lyme disease, but patients with fibromyalgia generally have diffuse pain, and they lack objective evidence of joint inflammation.
Other inflammatory arthritides, such as rheumatoid arthritis, reactive arthritis, or psoriatic arthritis may develop within months after Lyme disease, seemingly triggered by the spirochetal infection. Thus, these entities should be considered in the differential diagnosis. In endemic areas, concomitant positive serologic results for Lyme disease in patients with other inflammatory arthritides can present a diagnostic challenge, since antibody responses to B. burgdorferi following antibiotic-treated Lyme arthritis typically persist for many years.
