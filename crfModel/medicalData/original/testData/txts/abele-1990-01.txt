In recent years, species of Borrelia have been recognized as the etiologic agents of several apparently diverse diseases, including erythema chronicum migrans (ECM); Lyme disease (LD); acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans (ACA); lymphadenosis benigna cutis (LBC), originally called Spiegler-Fendt sarcoid; and possibly some types of morphea, lichen sclerosus et atrophicus (LSA), progressive facial hemiatrophy of Parry-Romberg (PFH), benign lymphocytic infiltrate of the skin (Jessner-Kanof) (BLI), and Shulman syndrome (eosinophilic fasciitis). Lyme disease was reviewed in Part I of this series. [1] ACA, LBC, LSA, PFH, BLI, and Shulman syndrome have been linked in varying degrees with borreliae and are the subject of this review.
