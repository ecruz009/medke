Serum samples were tested for evidence of infection by the agents of Lyme disease (B. burgdorferi), human monocytic ehrlichiosis (Ehrlichia chaffeensis), human granulocytic ehrlichiosis (Ehrlichia phagocytophila), Rocky Mountain spotted fever (Rickettsia rickettsii), murine typhus (Rickettsia typhi), Q fever (Coxiella burneti), tularaemia (Francisella tularensis) and babesiosis (Babesia microti). IgG antibodies against antigens of E. chaffeensis, E. phagocytophila, R. rickettsii, R. typhi, C. burneti, and B. microti were tested by indirect fluorescent antibody assays (IFA), as previously described (11–14). The serum samples were screened against F. tularensis by an agglutination assay, according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI, USA).
IgG antibodies against the Lyme disease spirochaete were initially detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using antigens of the N40 strain of B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (15). Briefly, low-passage wildtype N40 was harvested at log-phase growth, washed three times in Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS), and resuspended in 20 times the original culture volume in HBSS. The washed spirochaetes were sonicated on ice until darkfield microscopy indicated that >85% of the organisms had been disrupted. After centrifugation to remove fragments and whole spirochaetes, the soluble extract was aliquoted and stored at –20C. Microtitre plates (Immulon 4, Dynex, Chantilly, VA, USA) were coated with 250 mg of antigen per well and allowed to dry. The plates were blocked with 5% donor horse serum, 1% dextran sulfate in PBS-Tween 20. Sera were diluted in this blocking buffer at 1:100, added to wells in triplicate, and incubated for 1 hour. Bound antibody was detected by the addition of alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat antihuman IgG (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD, USA), as recommended by the manufacturer. A p-nitrophenyl phosphate substrate in diethanolamine buffer was used to visualize bound secondary antibody when the reactions were terminated at 30 minutes, and read promptly at l = 405 nm. Negative control sera (n = 6), taken from laboratory staff members with no history of Lyme disease, were analysed on each plate. A serum sample was considered reactive if its mean absorbance exceeded 3 standard deviations of the mean of the 18 (6 x 3) negative control wells, calculated for each microtitre plate.
