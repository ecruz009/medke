Lyme arthritis was originally recognized because of an outbreak of monoarticular and oligoarticular arthritis in children in Lyme, Connecticut in the 1970s. [1] It then became apparent that Lyme disease was a complex multisystem illness affecting primarily skin, nervous system, heart or joints. [2] Prior to the use of antibiotic therapy for treatment of the disease, about 60% of untreated patients developed Lyme arthritis, a late disease manifestation. [3] In recent years, over 30,000 cases of Lyme disease have been reported annually to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and in a third of reported cases, arthritis was a manifestation of the disease. [4] However, recent CDC estimates suggest the actual number of infections with the Lyme disease spirochete may be 10-fold higher. [5]
The infection is transmitted primarily by nymphal Ixodes scapularis ticks, which quest in the late spring and early summer. [6] However, Lyme arthritis can present at any time of the year. The majority of cases occur in the northeastern United States, from Maine to Virginia. [5] Other affected areas in the U.S. include the northern mid-Western states of Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan; and the West coast in northern California.
In the United States, Borrelia burgdorferi is the sole cause of the disease, but subtypes of B. burgdorferi differ in pathogenicity. [7,8] OspC type A (RST1) strains, which account for 30-50% of the infection in the northeastern US, [7,8] but only 3% in mid-Western states, [9] are particularly virulent and arthritogenic. These strains are thought to have played an important role in the emergence of the Lyme disease epidemic in the northeastern U.S. in the late 20th century. [10]
