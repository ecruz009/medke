Lyme disease (LD) is a tick-borne infection caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi. Primary LD commonly presents as a flu-like ifiness in children, sometimes accompanied by the diagnostic rash known as erythema migrans (EM). [1] Rheumatologic, neurologic, dermatologic, or cardiologic manifestations in systemic LD may follow the primary infection by weeks or months, or they may be the initial presentation of LD. A wide variety of neurologic syndromes have been reported in both children and adults with LD, ranging from acute myositis to chronic encephalopathy. However, facial palsy and aseptic meningitis are the most commonly reported neurologic manifestations. [2]
The nonspecificity of clinical presentations and limitations in laboratory diagnosis complicate the diagnosis of neuroborreliosis. While Lyme serology is considered highly sensitive in systemic LD, false positives may be due to asymptomatic seroconversion, antibodies to oral spirochetes, prior infection, or immunologic cross reaction to other pathogens. Several authors have emphasized the precedence of clinical criteria for making diagnostic and treatment decisions in patients with suspected LD. [3-5] When new neurologic symptoms appear in concert with other clinical manifestations typical of LD, the diagnosis of neuroborreliosis is usually secure.
Because individuals with systemic signs of LD are usually seropositive, we reviewed clinical data in seropositive children to determine 1) how often the initial clinical evaluation permitted a diagnosis of neuroborreliosis, and 2) the range of neurologic signs in children with positive Lyme serology.
