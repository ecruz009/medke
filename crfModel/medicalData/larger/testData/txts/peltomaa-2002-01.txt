Acute peripheral facial paralysis (FP) is a relatively common symptom with an annual incidence of 15 to 40 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. [1, 2] In up to 75% of the cases the etiology has remained obscure, and then the symptom has been called Bellâ€™s palsy.During the last few decades, knowledge of the etiology of acute FP, especially concerning the role of infections, has increased. [3] Spirochetal infections like syphilis and relapsing fever are known causes of FP. [4] In a study of nearly 1,000 patients with Lyme borreliosis (LB), FP occurred in 10% of patients as well. [5]
