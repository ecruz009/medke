Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb), a motile, helical gram-negative bacterium, belongs to the spirochete family. It stains with Giemsa or special silver stains and can be visualized under phase contrast or dark field microscopy. The spirochete, 10- to 30-pm long and 0.2- to 0.3-~tm wide, has a central protoplasmic cylinder with 7 to 12 attached periplasmic flagella surrounded by an outer cell membrane that is covered by a carbohydrate-containing slime layer. Bb contains chromosomal DNA and extrachromosomal double-stranded DNA in the form of distinct supercoiled circular and linear plasmids. Both chromosomal and plasmid DNA code for proteins, some of which are not unique to Bb. These include p41 (flagellin-a protein common to spirochetes) and p58-60, p66, p68, p71, and p73 (heat-shock proteins). These conserved but nonspecific borrelia proteins cause serological cross-reactivity, as discussed later. Bb-unique proteins include: plasmid-coded outer surface lipoproteins (Osp) 31 kDa (OspA); 34 kDA (OspB); 23 kDA (OspC); newly recognized proteins OspD, OspE, OspF; and p93, a protein that appears to be a protoplasmic cylinder antigen, and p39, a unique lipoprotein.
