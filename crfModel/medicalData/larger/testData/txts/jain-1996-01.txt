Lyme disease, or Lyme borreliosis, is a tick-borne infection caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi. Several studies have reported facial palsy to be the most common physical sign of neurologic Lyme borreliosis (neuroborreliosis) [2, 12, 16]. The proportion of facial palsy due to Lyme borreliosis on Long Island, New York, has been estimated to be 25% [8], and in a European study of children, 33% of acute facial palsy cases were due to Lyme borreliosis.
