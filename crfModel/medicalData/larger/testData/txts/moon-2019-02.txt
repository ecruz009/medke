For laboratory diagnosis of Lyme disease, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) recommend an initial enzyme immunoassay (EIA) or immunofluorescence assay, and if positive or equivocal, then a confirmatory Western blot for immunoglobulin M or G (IgM and IgG) (Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC), 1995). An IgG Western blot is considered confirmatory regardless of sample draw timing, whereas an IgM Western blot is only recommended if signs and symptoms have been present for less than a month (Seriburi et al., 2012).
