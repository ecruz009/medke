The idea that the customer is always right is gospel in most areas of business. Most, you might think, except the business of making drugs and vaccines. Not so. The cautionary tale of the Lyme-disease vaccine is a good example of how consumer power can override science.
Lyme disease is a debilitating infection spread by bites from ticks. Found mainly in the United States and Europe, its prevalence is increasing as civilization encroaches on forested areas - home to the deer on which the ticks feed. A vaccine is badly needed to contain the disease, but the one jab available was pulled from the market after complaints from a group of patients damaged its reputation. Now, a similar vaccine is set to emerge, but some say it has been tweaked in a way that confers no obvious scientific benefit. Lyme disease made a meteoric entry into medical and public consciousness 30 years ago, when Allen Steere, a rheumatologist now at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, described an outbreak of a mysterious illness in Lyme, Connecticut. The disease he identified was caused by a spirochete, a spiral-shaped bacterium called Borrelia burgdorferi. It is rarely fatal, but acute infection results in a range of unpleasant and debilitating symptoms, including flu-like effects, a bullseye rash and neurological problems such as facial palsy. After several weeks without treatment, some patients go on to develop joint pain or arthritis. If left untreated, it can last for years, but even then will usually respond to antibiotics. In a small subset of patients, however, the joint pain and swelling do not respond - the condition is known as treatment-resistant Lyme arthritis.
It was arguments about the long-term persistence of Lyme disease that triggered the first 'Lyme scandal'. In the 1990s, Steere was hounded by patients who claimed to be suffering from a chronic form of Lyme disease that left them persistently exhausted. Steere insisted that they had been misdiagnosed.
Although the patients had antibodies to Lyme disease, indicating that they had at one time been exposed to Borrelia, Steere maintained that their range of vague symptoms did not correlate with the true course of the disease. He says he wanted to save people from unnecessary antibiotic treatment, but instead found himself under protection of security guards, and dealing with hate mail and even death threats.
