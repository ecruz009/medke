In our experience, some patients do require longer courses of antibiotic therapy for effective treatment of Lyme arthritis. [12] Thus, if there is mild residual joint swelling after a 30-day course of oral antibiotics, we repeat the oral antibiotic regimen for another 30 days. However, for patients who continue to have moderate-to-severe joint swelling after a 30-day course of oral antibiotics, we treat with IV ceftriaxone, 2gm/day. Although there is trend
toward greater efficacy with 4 weeks compared with 2 weeks of antibiotics, there is also a greater frequency of adverse events. [38] Thus, our practice is to prescribe a 4-week course of IV therapy, but to monitor the patient closely and to stop the antibiotic if complications occur.
Even in patients who had minimal or no improvement with oral doxycycline, we typically observe moderate improvement or even complete resolution of arthritis with IV therapy. Moreover, even in those with persistent joint inflammation, the synovitis tends to change after IV therapy with decreased size of effusions but continued synovial tissue hypertrophy and inflammation. Courses of longer than 30 days of IV antibiotics seem not to be beneficial and may be associated with a still greater frequency of adverse effect. [39] Additionally, a recent double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of patients in Europe did not find a benefit of additional oral amoxicillin therapy following treatment with IV ceftriaxone. [40] A number of newer oral antibiotics in an FDA approved drug library, including daptomycin, carbomycin, and cefoperazone, have been shown to have marked efficacy against persisting spirochetes in culture, [41] but it is not yet known whether such antibiotics would be effective in patients with Lyme arthritis that is more difficult to treat.
