Only a small minority of facial palsy cases are bilateral. Although unilateral facial palsy is commonly idiopathic, the majority of bilateral facial palsy cases have an identifiable cause. [28, 29, 30, 31] The association of bilateral facial palsy and Lyme disease has been previously recognized. [22, 32] In our multivariate analysis, bilateral facial palsy was an independent predictor of Lyme disease. Because the predictor was not validated by bootstrap methods (selected in less than half of the 1000 iterations), we did not include bilateral facial palsy in our final multivariate analysis. However, bilateral facial palsy might be selected as a predictor of Lyme disease facial palsy in a larger size cohort or with an independent external validation. Clinicians treating patients with bilateral facial palsy should strongly consider obtaining diagnostic testing for Lyme disease.
