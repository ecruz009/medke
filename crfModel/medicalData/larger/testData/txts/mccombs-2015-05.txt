In some cases, Lyme disease-associated facial paralysis may be confused with other neurological disorders, such as Guillain-Barre syndrome or Bell’s Palsy. The CDC reported that clinical manifestations of Lyme disease-associated Bell’s Palsy were evident in 9% of confirmed cases from 2001 to 2010. [8] Persistent musculoskeletal Lyme disease-associated arthritis may also mimic or trigger fibromyalgia. Symptoms of fibromyalgia, however, cannot be cured with antibiotics. In many cases, people thought to have fibromyalgia actually have Lyme disease, and vice versa. Although most Lyme disease-related joint pain and swelling are associated with large joints in the knees and hips, the joint first affected may not correlate to the site of the initial skin lesion or tick bite. Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) pain has also been linked to Lyme disease.
