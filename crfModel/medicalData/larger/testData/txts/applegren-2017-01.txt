For patients in category 1, proper care needs to be practiced when removing ticks, especially the Ixodes genus, from the skin. It is often difficult to definitively identify a tick as I. scapularis in the ED; however, in endemic areas with high LD prevalence or in cases where there is high clinical suspicion for tick exposure, emergency physicians should evaluate and treat patients with the assumption that the tick is I. scapularis and consider sending the tick for pathology identification. Ixodes ticks cement their mouth parts into the skin with secretions from their salivary glands and have specialized structures for holding them in the skin while the tick feeds. Attached ticks should be removed with fine-tip forceps. Any portion of the mouth parts of the tick still embedded in the skin need not be removed and only disinfected, for there is no risk of LD and the removal can cause unnecessary tissue damage. Use of hot objects, such as matches, is contraindicated and may induce regurgitation and cause infected fluids to enter the wound (44).
