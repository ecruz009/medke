It is customary to divide Lyme disease into three stages. The “primary lesion” or early localized stage occurs at the site of Borrelia inoculation. The infection is manifest as erythema migrans (migrating redness), an erythematous papule that expands centrifugally over days to become a plaque, with or without central clearing (Fig. 2). With the development of EM, the patient may also have constitutional symptoms such as fever, malaise, and headache. The skin lesion may have localized pain or pruritus, and regional lymphadenopathy may develop. In ~20% of untreated subjects, this early stage with EM remains the only manifestation of Lyme disease. In the first few weeks after infection, spirochetes can be cultured from blood of up to 45% of American patients, indicating that they disseminate via the bloodstream to other tissues [101-103]. Note, however, that culture isolation from blood is much less frequently achieved in European patients (0.7-7.7%) [104-106], possibly suggesting other routes of dissemination. The “secondary lesions” of Borrelia infection, the early disseminated stage, comprises multiple EM lesions, widespread erythematous plaques that are smaller but morphologically similar to the initial lesion. The early disseminated stage may also be associated with Lyme neuroborreliosis (LNB), and carditis. European patients may also develop a skin lesion called borrelial lymphocytoma during this stage (Fig. 3). The “tertiary skin lesion” of this infection, identified for decades before the association with Borreliawas known, is acrodermatitis chronic atrophicans, a focal area of atrophic skin usually involving an extremity. Acordermatitis chronica atrophicans (ACA) is primarily found in Europe, and is most commonly associated with the late disseminated stage, which can also include late neurological manifestations. Although LA can occur during the early disseminated stage, it is more commonly observed during the late disseminated stage.
