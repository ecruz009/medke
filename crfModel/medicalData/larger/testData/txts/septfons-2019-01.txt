Lyme borreliosis (LB) is caused by spirochaetes of the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato species complex, which are transmitted by different Ixodes spp. ticks [1]. The most common clinical manifestation is erythema migrans (EM). However, in the absence of antibiotic treatment the infection can spread and cause severe manifestations affecting a patientâ€™s skin, nervous system, joints, or heart [1].
