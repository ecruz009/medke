Physical exam revealed facial symmetry, and numbness in right chin in nerve distribution. She was diagnosed with possible Lyme cranial neuritis. Doxycycline was continued and pregabalin was started. On day #10 of doxycycline, she woke up and noticed that her right face was paralyzed and was unable to close the right eye, so she went to the local emergency department. The EM was improved from 4 to 2 cm residual rash. Because of her headaches, a lumbar puncture and brain MRI were recommended. Cerebrospinal spinal fluid analysis revealed only 3 WBCs, protein 30.2 g/dL, glucose 62 mg/L, Lyme serology pair CSF fluid O.D. = 0.114 (borderline), serum Lyme serology pair O.D. = 0.409 (reactive), serum IgM Western blot positive (bands present: 23 and 41 kDa), serum IgG Western blot indeterminate (bands: 41,58 and 93 kDa), CRP remained less than 0.1 mg/dL. MRI of the brain showed new increased enhancement involving the right facial nerve (Figure 1). She was discharged on minocycline 100 mg orally twice a day for 21 days. Two days later, her right side headaches improved significantly. The facial paralysis completely resolved after 1 week. At 3 months follow-up, she recovered completely without any complications.
