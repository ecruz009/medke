Patients with Lyme arthritis are initially treated with a 4-week course of oral antibiotics. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs are often used to ameliorate symptoms during and after antibiotic treatment. Incomplete resolution of arthritis at 4 weeks has been observed in 40% of patients, and an additional course of oral or intravenous antibiotics may be necessary (37). No controlled trials are available to guide the decision regarding whether further antibiotics should be prescribed versus antiinflammatory medications, including intraarticular corticosteroids, to hasten arthritis resolution. Arthritis may be considered refractory to antibiotics if it persists for 2 months after a course of intravenous antibiotics or 1 month after two 4-week courses of oral antibiotics (if parenteral therapy is not possible) and the results of PCR testing of SF are negative for borrelia DNA [37]. Antibiotic-refractory Lyme arthritis is not likely due to persistent infection because intraarticular steroids [36] and/or DMARD therapies (hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine, or methotrexate), and rarely TNF antagonists, have been used successfully without signs of recrudescent infection in the joint or elsewhere [35]. Synovectomy can be curative if most of the synovial tissue is removed; excised synovial tissue has been uniformly negative for B burgdorferi by PCR and culture [41].
