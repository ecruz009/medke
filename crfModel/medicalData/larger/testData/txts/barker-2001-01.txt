To reduce the risk of tick bites while in the field, the current Department of Defense (DoD) repellent system was adopted in 1991.9 This system provides specific personal protective measure (PPM) guidelines for use with the military field uniform, which provides barrier and chemical protection against arthropod borne infections. However, compliance with these guidelines has been demonstrated to be inadequate, even under conditions of high risk for arthropod-related disease transmission and nuisance bites. Although medical threat briefings are commonly given prior to field missions, studies suggest not only that military personnel have poor knowledge of military PPM guidelines, but that command enforcement of military PPM guidelines is low, and that a variety of less effective commercial repellent products are preferred by troops over military-issue products. [10,11] Due to lack of compliance with PPM guidelines, the Armed Forces Epidemiological Board has been evaluating how the ACIP Lyme disease vaccine recommendations should be incorporated into DoD vaccination policies. The primary objective of this study was to provide objective epidemiological data that would better characterize the risk for Lyme disease infection among military personnel. The seroepidemiology of this pathogen was evaluated in a randomly selected sample of U.S. military personnel, and demographic characteristics and other risk factors for infection were assessed.
