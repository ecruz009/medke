LD is caused by the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato bacterium that can be spread to humans by infected ticks. Surveillance suggests that the number of cases of LD is increasing in Europe and North America (Lorenc et al., 2017). A common early sign of the disease is an erythema migrans or a ‘bulls-eye’ rash surrounding the bite (Wormser et al., 2006). Some people also report flu-like symptoms (fatigue, muscle pain, headaches, fever and neck stiffness) (NHS, 2018). More serious and persistent symptoms (chronic LD) may develop if not treated or after treatment (post-treatment LD), including pain and swelling in the joints, problems affecting the nervous system, and heart problems (NHS, 2018). However, there is controversy over the existence of persistent symptoms and there is no agreed treatment (Rebman et al., 2017 p.535).
