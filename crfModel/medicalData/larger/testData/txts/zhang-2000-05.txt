Whether Lyme neuroborreliosis causes stroke is equally inconclusive, although a few case reports imply that possibility. [9,12-14] The proposed pathogenesis is that localized vasculitis may cause focal brain symptoms as part of a more generalized vasculopathy. [10,12] Angiography has demonstrated changes in cerebral vessels compatible with vasculitis in a few cases of Lyme neuroborreliosis with strokelike symptoms. [13,14] Interestingly, our patient had ‘‘vasculitis’’ in the right lower extremity 8 years earlier. However, with no history of recurrence, any relationship to current Lyme neuroborreliosis was tenuous.
