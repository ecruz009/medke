In TBE the involvement of cranial nerves has been reported only occasionally and in only a subset of patients with cranial nerve involvement does facial palsy develop [5â€“22]. This is in contrast to Lyme borreliosis, which has been associated with a wide range of neurological disorders including meningitis, cranial neuritis, radiculoneuritis, peripheral neuritis in association with acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans and, rarely, meningoencephalitis and encephalopathy, and in which peripheral facial palsy (PFP) is common.
