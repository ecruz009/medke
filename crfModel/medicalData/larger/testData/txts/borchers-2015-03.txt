If left untreated, ~60% of patients with EM develop brief recurrent episodes of arthritis, often preceded and accompanied by arthralgias and myalgias [4]. Patients with EM would be treated with antibiotics today and would rarely if ever develop arthritis. Therefore, patients diagnosed with LA today must come mainly from those subsets of patients whose EM goes unnoticed or undiagnosed or who do not develop EM or any other typical early manifestations of Lyme disease. Approximately one-fourth of adults and between 16 and 37% of children with LA recall a tick bite [172,247-250]. More importantly, almost 30% of adults give a history of EM [172], even in case series recruited within the last decade [247], while the proportion in children has ranged between 4 and 18% in recent cohorts [247,251,252]. According to data from a large vaccine trial in which participants were very closely monitored, 16% of patients with Bb infection have only systemic symptoms (primarily headaches and arthralgias) [253] that would not likely be recognized as Lyme disease by the patient or the treating physician. An additional 7e11% of the participants show asymptomatic seroconversion [68,254]. Even under the worst-case scenario that 60% of these two patient subgroups develop LA, one would expect arthritis to be the presenting manifestation in only ~16% of patients with Lyme disease in the US. Rather surprisingly, patients with LA continue to represent ~30% of the cases reported to the CDC [159]. In contrast, the observed rate in large case series of adults and children with Lyme disease has been 6% [160,161].  In other words, the majority of cases of LA in the US would seem to be preventable. LA constitutes 4e8% of cases of Lyme borreliosis in European epidemiological studies [51,53,54,163], although the results of a Swedish study suggest that LA may be underdiagnosed [255]. While Lyme disease overall affects men and women with similar frequency, up to 75% of adults and 70% of children with LA are male not only in the US [4,247,248,250,251,256-258], but also in Europe [170,172,249,259,260].
