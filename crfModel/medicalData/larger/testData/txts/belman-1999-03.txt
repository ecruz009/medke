Aseptic meningitis. In the absence of EM or FNP, Lyme meningitis may be indistinguishable from aseptic (viral) meningitis. In both conditions, patients may have headache, neck stiffness, and fever. CSF cell count and chemistries are identical, and both have a seasonal occurrence. If meningitis develops in the spring, summer, or fall, and the child lives in or has recently traveled to an endemic area, and Lyme disease is suspected, serum and CSF anti-B, burgdorferi antibodies should be obtained.
Facial nerve palsy. The clinical features of Lyme-associated facial nerve palsy are similar to those of idiopathic Bell's palsy. In the absence of EM, Lyme disease should be considered if the child lives in or has recently traveled to an endemic area and the onset of paralysis is in the spring, summer, or fall. Anti-B. burgdorferi antibody titers in serum should be obtained. If positive, CSF examination to detect occult meningitis is recommended by many. [54,72,75,98] If negative, we repeat serological studies in 6 to 8 weeks.
Optic nerve edema/optic neuritis/increased intracranial pressure. The above also applies for the child who has Lyme disease exposure, without a history of EM, and presents with optic neuritis or optic nerve edema with or without other signs of increased intracranial pressure. Other causes should be excluded by appropriate studies.
