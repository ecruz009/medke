Adiagnosis of Lyme neuroborreliosis was confirmed thereafter by positive serologic findings on both enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western blot. The patient refused lumbar puncture for cerebrospinal fluid analysis. He was started on an intravenous ceftriaxone regimen on hospital day 6. His clinical condition and functional status promptly improved. At discharge on hospital day 10, he needed close supervision for ADL and transfer, and ambulated 250 feet with improved gait. The patient had regained full left UE strength and functional independence at the end of the 4-week antibiotic therapy.
