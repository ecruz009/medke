The appearance of new or recurrent objective signs of Lyme disease after antibiotic therapy should prompt evaluation for reinfection or incomplete treatment. A recent study in which the causative strain of B burgdorferi was cultured from EM lesions showed that recurrent EM after treatment was due to reinfection rather than a relapse of the previously treated infection [46].
In 25% of patients with EM, clinical disease resolves but fatigue, cognitive problems, or joint and muscle aches persist at 3 months after treatment; this percentage decreases to 10% at 6 months. Posttreatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS) refers to such symptoms that last for 6 months after a documented episode of Lyme disease and are disabling. The frequency with which PTLDS occurs is believed to be substantially below 10%. PTLDS should not be confused with "chronic Lyme disease." This name originally referred to late manifestations of the disease, but has been usurped as a label for clinical syndromes that may or may not be associated with previous Lyme borrelia exposure [47].
The reasons for persistence of symptoms in some patients after treatment for Lyme disease are not known. Theories include residual damage to tissue, slow resolution of the inflammatory state, and/or a form of cytokine-induced sickness behavior due to previously high levels of circulating cytokines. Systemic inflammatory cytokines exert adverse effects on neurobehavioral function in other conditions, independent of a central nervous system infection [8]. Nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue and pain are common in the general population as well.
