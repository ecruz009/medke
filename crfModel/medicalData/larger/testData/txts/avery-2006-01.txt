Patients were classified as having LM if they met the criteria established by the CDC for Lyme disease (positive serology with Western blot confirmation or erythema migrans observed by a physician) and had meningitis. [1] Criteria for serologic diagnosis were based on published criteria for results from commercial laboratories [8] and our hospital's laboratory. [9] If initial Lyme-serology results were equivocal but follow-up testing was positive, these children were considered to have Lyme disease. Patients with meningitis who did not meet CDC criteria for Lyme disease were classified as having AM. The final discharge diagnosis of all patients was extracted from the medical chart.
Laboratory values (Lyme serology, CSF red blood cell count, CSF WBC, CSF WBC differential, CSF bacterial culture, CSF viral culture, and CSF enterovirus PCR) and demographic information (age, gender, race, and month of presentation) were abstracted electronically from our hospitalâ€™s laboratory database. Lyme serology was completed by our hospital laboratory using a previously described protocol. [9] Standard techniques were used for CSF bacterial and viral cultures. The virology laboratory of the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (Philadelphia, PA) performed all enterovirus CSF PCR testing.
