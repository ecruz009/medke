The stages of Lyme disease include the early localized stage, early disseminated stage, and late disseminated stage. The early localized stage begins 3 to 30 days after the initial tick bite. A localized, erythematous, circular macule or papule known as erythemamigrans (EM) develops during this stage at the site of the tick bite in 70% to 80% of individuals. It expands over the course of days to weeks, sometimes with central clearing to give a bull’s-eye appearance. [8, 9] Erythema migrans is themost common clinical manifestation of Lyme disease and is a result of cutaneous infection by B burgdorferi. [10] Erythema migrans is ≥5 cm across the largest diameter (Fig 2). [9] Patients with or without EM may also exhibit flulike symptoms, including fatigue, headache, lymphadenopathy, arthralgia, myalgia, low-grade fever, and chills.
