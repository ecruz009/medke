Neuroborreliosis in our patient was diagnosed by clinical symptoms, CSF and serum analysis. In serum and CSF, IgM was positive and IgG intermediates for B. burgdorferi using the ELISA and immunoblot. The antibody specificity index was significantly positive for B. burgdorferi. In addition, Borrelia-IgM-CSF/serum ratio was elevated and showed intrathecal synthesis of specific antibodies as well as oligoclonal-IgG bands in isoelectric focusing electrophoresis. These results strongly argue for neuroborreliosis. [9, 10]
