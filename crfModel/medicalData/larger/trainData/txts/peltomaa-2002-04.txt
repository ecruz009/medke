Bilateral occurrence is a special feature of the FP caused by LB. Paralysis is bilateral in 18% to 25% of the FP patients with LB, [5, 11] whereas the prevalence of bilateral paralysis is only 0.3% to 2% in Bellâ€™s palsy. [13] In the current prospective study we screened consecutive patients with FP for antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi and for symptoms or signs related to LB. We analyzed the risk factors for the occurrence of LB among the FP patients and for a poor outcome of FP. Strict criteria were applied for the diagnosis of LB.
