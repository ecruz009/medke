Low-quality evidence suggested that permethrin-treated (vs. untreated) battle uniform [Faulde et al., 2015] and Citriodiol insect repellent [Gardulf et al., 2004] may reduce the frequency of tick bites. [Faulde et al. (2015)'s] historical controlled study showed that in 2009, tick bite incidence was 39.3 with 262 bites in 66,679 exposure days, whilst in 2010 (when the treated uniform was worn) the incidence was 0.16 with 53 bites in 63,571 exposure days (representing a 99.6% reduction). The same pattern of findings was reported in 2011 (representing a 98.6% reduction). In [Gardulf et al. (2004)'s] crossover RCT, lemon eucalyptus extract (Citriodiol10) was self-applied to participants' legs. Overall, there were fewer tick bites per person with the spray compared with no spray, (median 0.5, range 0 to 2 with; median 1.5, range 0 to 9 without; zâˆ’2.02, p < 0.05) and fewer ticks, that were crawling (not attached) (median 3.5, range 1 to 13 with; median 4.0, range 1 to 20 without; NS).
