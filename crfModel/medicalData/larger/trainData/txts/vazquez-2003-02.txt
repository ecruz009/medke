Peripheral craniopathy or facial nerve palsy is the single most common neurologic manifestation of Lyme disease in children. [2,3] In many cases, it may be the only neurologic abnormality present and it can develop without an antecedent erythema migrans rash. Lyme disease is identified as the causative agent in up to 25% of all cases of facial nerve palsy in children who reside in endemic areas. [4] Although more common in Europe, facial nerve palsy is found in 3% to 5% of all children with Lyme disease in the United States. [5] We are particularly interested in children with facial nerve palsy attributable to Lyme disease because they are a group that may be at particularly high risk for adverse neuropsychologic sequelae, because a high proportion have pleocytosis of the cerebrospinal fluid.
