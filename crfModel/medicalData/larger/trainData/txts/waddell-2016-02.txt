Ticks of the genus Ixodes transmit the spirochete when they feed. Ixodes scapularis, the blacklegged tick, is the main vector in northeastern and upper midwestern United States and Canada while I. pacificus is the major vector in western United States and western Canada [9,10]. The primary vectors of LD in Europe and Asia are I. ricinus and I. persulcatus respectively [6,11]. The principal natural hosts of immature stages of the ticks and B. burgdorferi include rodents, other small and medium sized mammals, reptiles and birds, while adult female ticks feed mainly on deer [12].
