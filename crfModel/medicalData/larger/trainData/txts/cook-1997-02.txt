In general, the duration of FNP with LD is reported to be shorter than with other causes of peripheral FNP. [11,15] Resolution may even begin before beginning treatment, and overall prognosis is typically good. [15,16] We did note several patients who had FNP lasting many months even after intravenous ceftriaxone.
The laboratory diagnosis of LD can be difficult. Erythrocyte sedimentation rates, while elevated, are nonspecific. Cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) lymphocytosis and elevated CSF proteins can be seen in viral meningitis as well as LD. Although specific antibody tests may be beneficial, in early LD, the IgM may not be positive for 3 to 4 weeks and the IgG may not be positive for 6 to 8 weeks. [14]
