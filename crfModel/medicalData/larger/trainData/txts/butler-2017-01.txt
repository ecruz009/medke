Tick-borne diseases (TBD) present a major public health problem in the United States, where 74.7%of clinicians in high-incidence states report having treated a patient for TBD in the previous year (Brett et al., 2014). In the United States, more than a dozen pathogens can be transmitted by five different genera ofticks (Shah and Sood, 2013). When a primary care provider sees a patient who has removed and saved an attached tick, it is important to identify the tick genus or common name to determine which pathogens were potentially transmitted and whether antibiotic prophylaxis for Lyme disease is appropriate. Some 41.1% of providers in states with high Lyme disease incidence recently reported providing tick-bite prophylaxis in the previous year (Brett et al., 2014). Notably, misidentification of a tick may lead to unnecessary prophylactic antibiotic treatment, unwarranted testing, or potentially a missed diagnosis of TBD. To date, only one study has been published on tick identification by providers in a Lyme disease endemic area (Falco et al., 1998). This study examined specimens submitted by physicians or medical groups to the Fordham University Vector Ecology Laboratory in Westchester County, NY between 1988 and 1990 for tick identification. Among 802 submitted specimens, 74.7% were blacklegged ticks (Ixodes scapularis). It is unclear, however, whether all of these specimens were initially suspected to have been blacklegged ticks and thus whether the remaining 25.3% were incorrectly identified. Notably, 5.9% of specimens submitted for tick identification were non-tick arthropods including beetles, crab lice, and head lice. It is also unknown how well this sample represents tick identification by providers during regular clinical practice and not as part of a tick identification service.
