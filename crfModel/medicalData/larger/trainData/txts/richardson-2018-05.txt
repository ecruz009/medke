Two RCTs [Wressnigg et al., 2014; Wressnigg et al., 2013] assessed the immunogenicity of a new multivalent vaccine for preventing LD. [Wressnigg et al. (2013)] found that whilst all doses (30, 60 or 90 μg), given on three occasions 28 days apart, and formulations (with or without an adjuvant to enhance the effect13) produced a positive response, the 90 μg non-adjuvanted formulation produced the highest response after the first three vaccinations. However, after a booster (9 to 12 months later), the 30 μg adjuvanted dose was most effective. [Wressnigg et al. (2014)] compared healthy people who were either seropositive [14] or seronegative [15] for LD. Participants received three doses (30 or 60 μg of vaccine with aluminium hydroxide adjuvant) 28 days apart, with a booster at 6 months or 9 to 12 months. In seronegative people, the antibody responses induced by the dose formulations were similar (p=0.062; range for 30 μg, 3799 to 6937, for 60 μg, 4575 to 8543). In seropositive people, the 60 μg dose (range, 4895 to 9435) resulted in significantly higher antibody response than the 30 μg dose (range, 2413 to 4371; p=0.0001). The booster response was effective at both time points, but more so when administered at 9 to 12 months. However, there was a dose effect among seropositive participants favouring the higher (60 μg) dose (p=0.0359; for five [16] of the six serotypes, (range 28,735 to 42,381), over the 30 μg dose (range 12,653 to 17,485).
