ee found that 10.9% of patients who received a misdiagnosis of Bell’s palsy went on to receive a diagnosis of Guillain-Barré syndrome on 90-day follow-up. Guillain-Barré syndrome encompasses multiple heterogeneous immune-mediated neuropathies, generally presenting with progressive and symmetric motor weakness and loss of deep tendon reflexes. Multiple variants of Guillain-Barré syndrome exist, with acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, the classic form with ascending paralysis, accounting for the majority of cases. [27] Variants of Guillain-Barré syndrome may involve the cranial nerves, including Miller Fisher syndrome, typically presenting with ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and areflexia with subsequent descending paralysis. Miller Fisher syndrome accounts for approximately 5% of all cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome and may progress in half of cases to cause various other cranial nerve abnormalities. [28,29] Additional variants of Guillain-Barré syndrome that may overlap with Miller Fisher syndrome and initially present with facial symptoms include Bickerstaff encephalitis and pharyngeal-cervical-brachial weakness, though both of these entities may have multiple associated symptoms that would generally preclude a diagnosis of Bell’s palsy. [30,31] More detailed research may be warranted to investigate the association between ED misdiagnosis of Bell’s palsy and subsequent diagnosis of Guillain-Barré syndrome.
