Lyme borreliosis or serological evidence of it has been found in 6% to 20% of adult patients with FP. [9, 10, 11] The incidence of LB is higher in children with FP than in adults with FP. In studies on pediatric FP, as many as two thirds of the patients have had LB. [12] In a German multicenter study, LB was diagnosed in every third child with FP all year around and in every second child during the warm season. [7] Thus, LB was the most frequently verifiable cause of FP in that study.
