A physical examination was conducted, with an initial clinical impression of supraspinatus tendinopathy and impingement. Therefore, procedures were undertaken in an attempt to confirm the initial clinical impression. Observation of the patient revealed: (1) flu-like symptoms (runny nose, sinus congestion, and itchy throat), which he attributed to a recent bout of sinus congestion due to seasonal allergies, and (2) poor sitting posture, which is a common observation in supraspinatus impingement. [1] Palpation examination of the right upper extremity revealed tenderness at the distal insertion of the supraspinatus tendon and in the supraspinatus muscle belly. A painful arc at 120 degrees of abduction, minimal scapular dyskinesia on the right side, and pain at end-range passive shoulder internal rotation were revealed in right shoulder range-of-motion testing in standing and supine positions as described by Magee. [25] After range-ofmotion testing, manual muscle testing (MMT) on a 0 to 5 scale was conducted using techniques suggested by Hislop and Montgomery. [26] The patientâ€™s strength measurements revealed right shoulder strength (force-generating capacity) of external rotation and abduction of 4/5 and provoked pain in the right shoulder.
