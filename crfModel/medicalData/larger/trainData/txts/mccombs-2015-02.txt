The life span of ticks vary from 2 years to 3 years. Blacklegged ticks have a four-stage life cycle: egg, larvae, nymph, and adult. Ticks feed only once during each stage, and male ticks of some species rarely feed and never engorge. Flat, unfed ticks attach to the host and engorge on a blood meal. The transmission of bacteria from the tick to the host comes from the saliva of the infected tick and is disseminated through the hostâ€™s blood or tissue to other locations. During the feeding process, ticks will concentrate ingested blood by returning much of the water and salts to the host; thus, alternating periods of sucking blood and salivation with regurgitation occur. Once the infected tick is attached, the chances of transmission of B. burgdorferi increase with time: 0% at 24 hours, 12% at 48 hours, 79% at 72 hours, and 94% at 96 hours. [7] Hence, the sooner the infected tick is discovered and removed, the better the outcome.
