Lyme disease, also referred to as Lyme borreliosis, was first clinically described in 1977 by Dr. Allen Steere, a rheumatologist who led an investigation of an outbreak of arthritis, initially believed to be juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, in 39 children and 12 adults clustered in the small town of Lyme, Connecticut. [1] First called “Lyme Arthritis”, he suspected this condition was caused by an arthropod-born infection, as most patients suffered from asymmetric swelling of large joints, many of whom also presented with an erythematous annular rash similar to that described decades earlier in Europe associated with the bite of the Ixodes ricinus tick. [2] Although the causative agent was unknown, the etiology was believed to be a bacterial pathogen in that the rash seemed to respond to treatment with penicillin. During this time, the entity was given several names including erythema chronicum migrans, Bannwarth’s syndrome, and acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans. [3] It was not until 1982 that Dr. Willy Burgdorfer, a microbiologist studying the microbiology of the hindgut of ticks, successfully isolated the pathogen, named in his honor Borrelia burgdorferfi, from I. damimini (I. scapularis) ticks found on Shelter Island, New York. [4,5] Subsequently, this causative spirochete bacterium has been isolated from the typical skin lesions, as well as blood and cerebrospinal fluid of infected individuals. Since its early discovery, Lyme disease has geographically spread to an extent that this zoonotic infection is currently the most prevalent vector-borne disease in both North America and Europe.
