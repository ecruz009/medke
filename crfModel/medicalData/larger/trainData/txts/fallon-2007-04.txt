Five patients withdrew from the study because of adverse events: two because of thrombus (both on drug), one because of staphylococcal infection (on placebo), one because of an  allergic reaction (on drug), and one because of worsening joint pain (on placebo) that required narcotic pain medication. Four patients remained in the study despite adverse events that required either early termination of study medication (three on drug; two with allergic reactions, and one with abdominal pain) or hospitalization (one on drug; cholecystectomy at week 16); for these patients, ratings at weeks 12 and 24 continued to be conducted without revealing treatment randomization. The adverse reactions of seven of these nine patients were thought likely to have been directly related to the study treatment (presence of a PICC line or medication), for a rate of treatment-related adverse events of 6 of 23 (26.1%) among patients given IV ceftriaxone and 1 of 14 (7.1%) among patients given IV placebo; all patients recovered fully.
