Among LNB hospitalised cases, 37% presented facial nerve disorders (including 27% with unilateral facial nerve paralysis), 35% had meningitis, 9% polyneuropathy and 9% encephalitis, myelitis or encephalomyelitis. HIR of LNB show a bimodal distribution of age with a first peak occurring in children aged 5–9 years old (1.3/100,000 of the age group) and a second peak in adults 70–79 years old (1.3 cases/100,000 of the age group). The proportion of hospitalised cases with LNB differed significantly by age (Figure 5). Among hospitalised cases, those age 5–9 and 70–79 years old were significantly more likely to have had LNB compared with other age groups (odds ratio (OR): 3.02; 95% CI: 2.41– 3.78 and OR: 1.94; 95% CI: 1.58–2.39, respectively).
