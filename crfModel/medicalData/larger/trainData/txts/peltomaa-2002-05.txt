An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) that uses B. burgdorferi flagellin as the antigen was used for the titration of antibodies in serum, as has been described previously. [14] The cutoff titers for serum immunoglobulin IgG and IgM antibodies were 500 and 2,500, respectively. These cutoff titers conform with the antibody level 3 standard deviations above the mean of a reference population living in an area in central Finland with a low LB prevalence. [14] The antibodies to B. burgdorferi in the CSF were tested by the same method used for serum. The cutoff limits for both the IgM and IgG antibodies in CSF were 3.0 in the same scale as applied to serum analysis. The IgG antibody titer of the CSF was divided by the total IgG concentration in the CSF. A corresponding ratio between the IgG antibodies and the total IgG concentration in the serum was also calculated. If the calculated ratio of the CSF was more than 2-fold higher than that of the serum, the IgG antibodies to B. burgdorferi in the CSF were considered to be intrathecally synthesized. Routine chemical and cytological analyses were performed on the CSF. Syphilis was ruled out as a source of false-positive serological results by an examination for Treponema pallidum antibodies (hemagglutination assay; Porton Cambridge, Newmarket, Great Britain).
