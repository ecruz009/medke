Despite the generally favorable outcomes of children with facial nerve palsy attributable to Lyme disease reported in previous studies, some of which included children who never received treatment for the disease, [8â€“11] there is widespread concern about possible long-term neurologic sequelae. Several reports in adults have suggested that there may be adverse cognitive effects from Lyme disease, [12,13] particularly in memory processes (short-term and longterm memory), intelligence, information processing speed, fine-motor dexterity, problem solving, and new learning. No studies have specifically evaluated the long-term outcomes of children with facial nerve palsy attributable to Lyme disease. The aim of this study is to assess the long-term neuropsychologic and health outcomes of children with facial nerve palsy attributable to Lyme disease.
