In addition to biofilm formation, the ability of Borrelia to localize intracellularly in the host has been proposed as a echanismwhichmight favor chronic or persistent infection and may contribute in reducing the efficacy of antibiotics. However, Borrelia predominantly occupies the extracellularmatrix, and the antibiotics recommended for the treatment of LB are first-line drugs in several intracellular infections (216, 217). Doxycycline and azithromycin are commonly used for the treatment of Mycoplasma, Chlamydia, and Legionella, while ceftriaxone is effective against Salmonella and Neisseria, and amoxicillin is used to treat Listeria infections (217, 218). Nevertheless, biofilm production by extracellular bacteria and intracellular localization of Borrelia are not mutually exclusive and may both participate in supporting chronic bacterial persistence in the host.
