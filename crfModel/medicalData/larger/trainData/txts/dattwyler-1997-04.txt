Signs and symptoms attributable to the nervous or musculoskeletal system have been noted by other investigators. Two separate, large, retrospective studies of patients treated for early Lyme disease found a surprisingly high incidence of continued signs and symptoms, especially if treatment was delayed. [8,9] Shadick et al. [8] found that 34 percent of patients in a suburban area of highly endemic disease just north of Boston who had been treated for early Lyme disease had long-term sequelae, including arthritis, arthralgia, cognitive impairment, and neuropathy. A similar investigation carried out in Westchester County, New York, [9] found that 114 of the 215 patients studied (53 percent) had persistent signs and symptoms, including neurologic, cardiac, and musculoskeletal disorders. Of the 114 patients with ongoing problems, 35 (31 percent) had clinically important fatigue and arthralgia as their chief symptoms. These retrospective studies suggest that perhaps more attention should be paid to minor post-treatment symptoms. Although arthralgia and fatigue have been reported after the administration of both oral and parenteral antibiotics for early Lyme disease, [6,16-18] the incidence is generally low. Mild arthralgia, fatigue, and headache were noted after therapy with intravenous ceftriaxone and oral penicillin, [17] and arthralgia was noted after oral treatment with amoxicillin plus probenecid or with doxycycline. [6] One year after treatment with cefuroxime axetil or doxycycline, approximately 10 percent of patients reported the persistence of mild-to-severe fatigue, arthralgia, and myalgia. [16]
