Whereas 10- to 30-day courses of oral doxycycline or amoxicillin are recommended for treating early infections (6,12,13), 30-day courses of these antibiotics are the most frequently recommended therapy for Lyme arthritis. With the exception of patients with isolated facial palsy, those with neurological involvement are often treated with intravenous ceftriaxone or penicillin for 2 to 4 weeks (14). The basis for a longer course of treatment for chronic infections with complications is that Borrelia burgdorferi is a very slow grower with a 12-hour or longer generation time (15), and the bacteria is believed to persist in the tissues, particularly within the central nervous system.
