The EM rash begins anywhere from 3 to 30 days after the bite occurs, but, on average, at 7 days, and then gradually expands. EM initially appears at the site of tick attachment but may appear anywhere on the body as the disease progresses. EM is distinguishable from an urticarial hypersensitivity response to the tick bite by observing for size of the lesion and expansion versus regression of the initial area.
