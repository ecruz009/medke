The onset of acute cerebellar ataxia varies from a few  days to several weeks after an acute febrile illness. Cerebellar signs are observed following many infectious diseases, including varicella-zoster, Epstein-Barr, entero-virus, rubeola, parvovirus, and mycoplasma infections. Varicella is among the most common of these infectious agents in young children. The pathogenesis of ataxia remains unclear, but emerging evidence suggests that an autoimmune mechanism may be involved. Antiviral antibodies and autoreactive antibodies targeting cerebellar neurons, possibly autoantibodies specific for the centrosome protein pericentrin, have been detected in the CSF of varicella patients. In other cases, viral nucleic acids have been identified in the CSF, suggesting that the pathogen may directly invade the central nervous system [12,13]. As can be seen in Table 1, cerebellar involvement in the form of cerebritis or acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis are described in patients with Lyme disease; however, this case is the first report of acute cerebellar ataxia associated with Lyme disease in the literature.
