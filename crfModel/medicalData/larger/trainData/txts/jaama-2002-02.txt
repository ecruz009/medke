VZV accounted for 33% of cases in children and 21% in adults (Table 1). In one patient, in both of these age groups, the infection was complicated by a concomitant HSV infection. The respective numbers in the control group were 11% in children and 13% in adults. The second most common associated agent was B. burgdorferi , which was found in 22% of children and 8% of adults (6% and none in controls). Together, VZV and B. burgdorferi accounted for 56% of all associated agents in children with FP compared with 11% in controls (P=0.01) and for 29% in adults with FP compared with 13% in controls (NS). In all, VZV or B. burgdorferi was detected in 41% of patients with FP and in 12% of controls (P=0.03). Other microbes were detected only occasionally. Treatable etiologic agents accounted for 52% of all FP cases compared with 26% of controls (P=0.04).
