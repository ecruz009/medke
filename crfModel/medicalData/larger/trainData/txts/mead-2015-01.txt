The risk of human infection with B burgdorferi is determined by the geographic distribution of vector tick species, local factors that increase or decrease tick abundance and rates of infection, and human behaviors that affect the likelihood of being bitten. In the Northeast where homes are often situated in heavily tick-infested areas, exposure is thought to occur primarily in the peridomestic environment immediately around the home. [44–47] In the North Central states, areas of highest risk are often lightly populated [48]; infection in these areas is more often related to weekend travel and recreation. Specific peridomestic risk factors include the presence of a suitable tick habitat, landscaping practices that enhance tick survival (eg, failure to clear leaf litter), deer density, and outdoor activities, such as gardening. [49–53] Certain occupations and hobbies also increase the risk of infection. Forestry workers, farmers, soldiers, hunters, hikers, and orienteers have higher rates of infection in studies from the United States, [54] Asia, [55,56] and throughout Europe. [57–61] Animal studies and clinical observations indicate that I scapularis ticks require at least 36 hours of attachment in order to transmit B burgdorferi, [62] supporting a possible preventive role for daily tick checks and showering after potential exposure. [53,63] Unfortunately, similar studies have demonstrated that I ricinus ticks, especially when infected with B afzelii, can transmit infection efficiently after much shorter periods of attachment.
