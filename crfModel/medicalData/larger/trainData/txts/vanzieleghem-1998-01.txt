Lyme disease is a tick-transmitted spirochaetal illness caused by B. burgdorferi. Its worldwide distribution correlated with the geographic ranges of certain ixodid ticks. Ixodes damnini and Ixodes pacificus are the principal vectors in the USA, whereas Ixodes ricinus and Ixodes persulcatus are the vectors throughout Europe and Asia, respectively. Central nervous system (CNS) presentations occur in 10Â±15% of cases; 23% of reported cases were in children and adolescents [1, 2].
