The causative agent, the spirochete B. burgdorferi, is maintained in an enzootic cycle with vector ticks of the Ixodes ricinus complex, which transmit the spirochete to small mammals. The ticks occur in three stages—larval, nymphal, and adult forms—that are interspaced by metamorphosis after a blood meal. Saliva, through which B. burgdorferi is transmitted, is an important facilitator for ticks: It contains substances with a locally anesthetizing effect and may prevent the clotting of human blood, which enables the tick to suck blood from superficial capillaries for 3 to 5 days. Although tick saliva contains antiallergic and anti-inflammatory mediators, it is antigenic to humans. Antiarthropod saliva antibodies can be measured in the serum of humans exposed to ticks. Ixodes scapularis is the main vector in Europe and the eastern United States. In a recent study from northern California, where the infestation of ticks is infrequent but probably increasing, measurement of antiarthropod saliva antibodies revealed the coexistence of seropositivity for Ixodes pacificus and B. burgdorferi, confirming that I. pacificus is the primary vector of Lyme disease in that area [1].
