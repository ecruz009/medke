It has been estimated that 10% to 40% of persons afflicted will develop neurologic abnormalities. [2-4] The clinical manifestations of Lyme neuroborreliosis are markedly diverse and include lymphocytic meningitis, cranial neuropathy, and radiculoneuritis in the early disseminated stage, and peripheral neuropathy (mainly sensory), chronic encephalopalomyelitis, and mild encephalopathy in the late persistent stage. [2,4-8] Only rarely do the neurologic abnormalities of Lyme disease simulate progressive stroke. [4,9,10] The case described here is one of Lyme neuroborreliosis presenting as hemiparesis.
