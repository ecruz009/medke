The distribution and relative frequency of infection by the different genospecies of Borrelia sensu latu vary across European regions. B. burgdorferi sensu lato comprises 20 different genospecies and this diversity correlates with the large variability in the clinical manifestations observed in LB (4, 13, 63). In the northern and eastern Europe B. afzelii is the most prevalent species, whereas in Western European countries B. garinii is the most common pathogen (4, 29). B. afzelii, B. garini, and the recently identified species B. bavariensis are major cause of LB and LNB in Europe (52, 64–68). The heterogeneity among B. burgdorferi sensu lato genospecies is linked to different geographical areas, which, in turn, correlates with the different clinical expression of human LB (69). For instance, B. afzelii induces prevalently skin infections, whereas B. garinii is in most cases neurotropic (5, 69). Other species, such as B. lusitaniae or B. valaisiana, have only occasionally been associated with human disease (70–72). In endemic areas of Europe was proposed that the variety of symptoms observed in children and adults with LNB correlated with the B. burgdorferi sensu lato genotype (73–75). Individuals with erythema migrans caused by B. afzelii and B. garinii showed distinct epidemiological and clinical characteristics. Indeed, erythema migrans caused by B. garinii were located prevalently on the trunk and less often on extremities, had shorter incubation and faster evolution, leading to frequent systemic symptoms, abnormal liver function test results than individuals with erythema migrans caused by B. afzelii (76, 77).
