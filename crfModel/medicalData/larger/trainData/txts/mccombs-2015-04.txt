In the early stage (3 days to 30 days post tick-bite), the classic sign of the “bull’s-eye” skin rash, or erythema migrans, appears in approximately 70% to 80% of patients. The rash may be warm, but is rarely painful or itchy and appears near the site of the bite. The rash can expand gradually over a period of days and parts of the rash will clear, resulting in the bull’s-eye appearance (Figure 1). This rash is extremely difficult to distinguish on nonwhite skin tones; thus, other symptoms should be considered. Additional signs of Lyme disease include: fatigue; headache; fever; chills; stiff neck; muscle aches; pain and swelling in large joints, such as knees; paralysis on one or both sides of the face; and enlarged lymph nodes. In later stages, the nervous system and heart may be affected.
