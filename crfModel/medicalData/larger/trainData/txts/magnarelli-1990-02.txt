Indirect fluorescent-antibody staining methods and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) are frequently relied upon to confirm Lyme borreliosis infections. These antibody tests are particularly useful when the clinical presentation is unclear. In an effort to improve the sensitivity of the ELISA, investigators have fractionated Borrelia burgdorferi, the etiologic agent of Lyme borreliosis, and have coated purified flagellin or flagellin-enriched subunits of this spirochete to the solid phase [6, 9]. Flagellin of B. burgdorferi has an approximate molecular mass of 41,000 daltons and shares epitopes with similar polypeptides extracted from other Borrelia spp. and from Treponema spp. [14]. Antigenic interrelationships among the endoflagella of treponemes are well documented [5]. Although sera from patients with Lyme borreliosis sometimes show reactivity in fluorescent treponemal antibody-absorption tests for syphilis [3, 10, 16, 20], Treponema pallidum infections can be excluded serologically with the Veneral Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) or rapid plasma reagin card tests [20].
