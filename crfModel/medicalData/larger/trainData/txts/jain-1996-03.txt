The true proportion of cases of facial palsy that are attributable to B. burgdorferi infection in areas where the disease is endemic has been estimated at between 6 and 33%, although no study included immunoblot confirmation of the infection [1, 4, 8, 9, 13]. Thus, empirical antibiotic treatment for all cases of acute facial palsy is not justifiable. Corticosteroids, which are often prescribed for idiopathic Bellâ€™s palsy, are unwarranted and perhaps deleterious in cases of infection [8]. There are often no clinical clues to suggest Lyme borreliosis at presentation, and the palsy may even precede EM. False-positive EIA and immunofluorescence assay results are common.
