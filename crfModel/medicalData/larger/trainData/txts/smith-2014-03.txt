The typical course of LS is a lifelong chronic condition that may relapse and remit or may lead to scarring and anatomical defects, with SCC being a more ominous but less likely complication of genital LS. [1] Treatment usually involves topical corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, retinoids, moisturizers and long-term surveillance for the development of carcinoma. [1] Antibiotics are used typically to treat associated infections that may develop; however, due to the possible role of Borrelia involvement, the question is raised as to whether antibiotics may be useful as a supplemental modality, as there are reports of LS treated with antibiotics with favourable outcomes. [9] Additional clinical trials to evaluate this further may be warranted. There are approximately 27 reported cases of oral LS with histological confirmation and eight cases involving the gingiva, [2] making this the 28th oral case and the ninth with gingival involvement. It also appears to be the first case of oral LS with Borrelia involvement identified by FFM reported in the United States. [1,7]
