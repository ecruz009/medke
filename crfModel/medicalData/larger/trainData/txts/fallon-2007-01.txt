Between January 2000 and April 2004, healthy volunteers (controls) and individuals with a history of Lyme disease (patients) between the ages of 18 and 65 years were recruited; follow-up evaluations were completed by April 2005. The institutional review boards at Columbia University and the New York State Psychiatric Institute approved the study, and all participants provided written informed consent. Evaluations were conducted at the New York State Psychiatric Institute and Columbia University Medical Center. Treatments were conducted at each patient’s home. Patients met the following criteria: (1) history of physician-documented erythema migrans or U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)-defined manifestation of Lyme disease, and a positive or equivocal ELISA confirmed by positive Western blot serology [6,7]; (2) current positive IgG Western blot using CDC surveillance criteria, assessed using a single reference laboratory (University Hospital of Stony Brook); (3) treatment for Lyme disease with at least 3 weeks of IV ceftriaxone, completed at least 4 months before study entry; (4) subjective memory impairment that, by participant report, started after the onset of Lyme disease; and (5) objective evidence of memory impairment as documented by the Wechsler Memory Scale–III [8] compared with age-, sex-, and education-adjusted population norms. These study criteria were conservative and narrow to enhance diagnostic confidence. Prior IV antibiotic therapy was required to ensure that all patients had received treatment considered adequate for neurologic Lyme disease by published guidelines. [9,10]
