Sixty patients (21.2 percent) received intravenous therapy. Ceftriaxone, with or without other antibiotics, was most frequently used (57, 95 percent). As expected, intravenous antibiotics were used more frequently (OR 3.7; CI 1.9-7.0; P<0.001) in those with arthritic, neurologic, and cardiac manifestations without EM (39, 34.2 percent) than in those with EM (21, 12.4 percent). In addition, intravenous therapy was more frequently used (OR 3.8; CI 1.3-11.2; P=0.009) in those with EM and arthritic, neurologic, and cardiac manifestations (14 of 65; 21.5 percent) than in those having EM only (7 of 104; 6.7 percent).
