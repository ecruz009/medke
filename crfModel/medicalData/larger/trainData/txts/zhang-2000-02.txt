Lyme disease is a multisystem infectious syndrome of considerable public concern, both because of its prevalence and because of the availability of diagnostic and therapeutic measures to combat it. It is now the most common arthropodborne infection in the United States, occurring in 48 of the 50 states at rates of up to 12,000 cases annually. [1] The causative organism, Borrelia burgdorferi, is a flagellated spirochete transmitted from small-mammal reservoirs to human beings through bites from infected ticks of the Ixodes species (commonly known as deer ticks).
