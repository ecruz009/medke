Laboratory findings from affected patient serum includes: elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), cryoprecipitates, an initially elevated serum IgM antibody titer with a later occurring elevation of serum IgG antibody titer, normal complement C3 levels, and an absence of rheumatoid factor or antinuclear antibodies. During phases of remission, the ESR shows significant reduction, but not always to normal levels. [22] The western blot is one testing method where the patient's blood is cross-reacted with a series of antigens that are derivatives of B burgdorferi's proteins. [13, 19] Other effective tests are an immunoflorescent assay (IFA titer) or an enzyme linked immunoassay (ELISA) method. [13, 19]
