Real-time PCR analysis. Total RNA was isolated from 2 x 10^6 monocytes using TRIzol solution (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was reverse-transcribed and amplified with the following primers: for GAPDH, 5'-AGCAACAGGGTGGTGGAC-3' and 5'-GTGTGGTGGGGGACTGAG-3'; for IL-23p19, 5'-TCC-ACCAGGGTCTGATTTTT-3' and 5'-TTGAAGCGGAGAAGGAGACG-3'; for IL-12p40, 5'-ACAAAGGAGGCGAGGTTCTAA-3' and 5'-CCCTTGGGGGTCAGAAGAG-3'; for IL-6, 5'-AACCTGAACCTTCCAAAGATGG-3' and 5'-TCTGGCTTGTTCCTCACTACT-3'; for TGFβ, 5'-AGTGGTTGAGCCGTGGAG-3' and 5'-CCATGAGAAGCAGGAAAGG-3'; and for IL-1, 5-CTGTCCTGCGTGTTGAAAGA-3' and 5'-TTGGGTAATTTTTGGGATCTACA-3'. After the amplification, data analysis was performed using the second derivative method algorithm. For each sample, the amount of messenger RNA (mRNA) of the cytokines (IL-23p19, IL-12p40, IL-6, TGFβ, and IL-1β) was expressed as the n-fold of the normalized amount of mRNA in untreated cells (1 arbitrary unit cytokine mRNA concentration/GAPDH mRNA concentration [both in fmoles/μl]).
