The median interval between the onset of FP and the assessment of antibodies to B. burgdorferi was 4 days (range, 0-20 days). In the LB group the geometric mean levels of the serum IgM and IgG antibodies to B. burgdorferi were 2.3-fold and 3.2-fold higher than the cutoff limits, respectively. Three patients had IgG antibodies only, and 7 patients had both IgG and IgM antibodies. None of the patients had IgM antibodies only. The T. pallidum hemagglutination assay was done for 8 of the 11 cases, and it was negative in all of them. CSF specimens from the 11 patients with LB were analyzed on admission, and 9 of them showed abnormalities. Eight (73%) were positive for antibodies to B. burgdorferi. Five patients had both IgM and IgG antibodies, 1 had IgM antibodies only (IgG antibodies not done), and 2 had IgG antibodies only. The geometric mean levels of the IgM and IgG antibodies were 46-fold (range, 3.3-530) and 24-fold (range, 2.3-330) higher than the cutoff limits, respectively. The Borrelia PCR test was carried out on CSF samples of 10 of the 11 patients and the sera of 9 of the 11 patients; the test was positive for one CSF sample only. Five (45%) of the patients had pleocytosis in the CSF (geometric mean of the leukocyte count, 148 106/L; range, 26-560 106/L). An elevated protein concentration (mean, 2,780 mg/L; range, 1,420-4,370 mg/L) was found in three patients.
