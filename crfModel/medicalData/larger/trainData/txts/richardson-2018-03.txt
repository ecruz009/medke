Two matched case-control studies sampled participants with and without LD (Connally et al., 2009; Vazquez et al., 2008). Findings showed that the use of tick repellents on skin or clothing was associated with lower rates of LD (adjusted9 OR 0.8, 95% CI 0.6 to 0.9 for Vazquez et al., 2008; OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.02, p < 0.1 for Connally et al. (2009). Similarly, Vazquez et al. (2008) showed that wearing protective clothes was effective (adjusted OR 0.6, 95% CI 0.5 to 0.7). Connally et al. (2009) (p > 0.20) reported that wearing light-coloured clothes (cases 88% v controls 90%) and long trousers (cases 65% v controls 70%) were less common among people diagnosed with LD, compared with controls, but the differences were not statistically significant. The evidence was mixed for tick checking; being identified as preventative in Connally et al. (2009) (OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.94), but not in Vazquez et al. (2008) (OR 1.1, 95% CI 0.8 to 1.4, NS). Connally et al. (2009) additionally showed that bathing within 2 h of being outside in the garden may prevent LD (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.96, p < 0.05).
