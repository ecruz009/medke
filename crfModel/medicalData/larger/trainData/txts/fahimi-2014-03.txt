Table 2 shows the results of our multivariate model, which identified multiple factors associated with the likelihood of receiving an alternative diagnosis. Demographic factors or comorbid conditions positively associated included increasing age (HR 1.11, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.21, for every 10 years), black compared with white race (HR 1.68; 95% CI 1.13 to 2.48), and diabetes mellitus (HR 1.46; 95% CI 1.10 to 1.95). The use of CT or MRI imaging on the index visit was also associated with an increase in the misdiagnosis of Bell’s palsy (HR 1.43; 95% CI 1.10 to 1.85). Private insurance compared with Medicare was negatively associated with an alternative diagnosis (HR 0.65; 95% CI 0.46 to 0.93).
The alternative diagnoses made on follow-up are listed in Table 3, stratified by 7-, 14-, 30-, and 90-day follow-up. Of the 356 individuals with an alternative diagnosis within 90 days, 142 (39.9%) were within 7 days. Most common at all 4 intervals were ischemic stroke, herpes zoster, Guillain-Barré syndrome, and otitis media, accounting for 85.4% of all alternative diagnoses.
