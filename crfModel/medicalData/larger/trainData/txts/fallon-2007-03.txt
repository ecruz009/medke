Baseline lumbar puncture, conducted in 33 of the 37 patients, revealed few abnormalities: mildly elevated WBC (two samples), mildly elevated protein (four samples), and elevated gammaglobulin (one sample). Positive results werenoted for 22 on Lyme ELISA, 28 on IgG WB, and none on IgM WB. For intrathecal Ab production, samples tested positive for 4 of 31 (12.9%) patients; each positive intrathecal sample was also seropositive. No patient had a positive CSF PCR. When cultured, one sample was positive for growth and revealed spirochetes by both phase contrast and dark-field microscopy. To exclude contamination as an explanation, the cellsâ€™s DNA was extracted and was used as a template for PCR amplification of the spoT gene. Examination of the PCR amplicon by agarose gel electrophoresis revealed an approximately 3-kbp band, whereas a PCR amplicon from wild-type strains was approximately 2 kbp. Additionally, the B burgdorferi isolated from the CSF culture was able to grow when transferred into BSKII containing kanamycin (5 g/mL) plus streptomycin (100 g/mL). These results strongly suggest that the B burgdorferi strain found in the CSF culture was the result of contamination by a spoT mutant strain (WC07) of B burgdorferi containing a deletion of part of the spoT gene plus the insertion of a streptomycin resistance gene; spoT mutant strains were under investigation in the lab at the time of the culture.
