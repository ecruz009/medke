Currently, the accuracy of serodiagnosis of Lyme borreliosis is limited by the high rate of false-positive enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and immunofluorescence assay results, which can lead to overdiagnosis [7, 15]. A positive or equivocal result should be confirmed by immunoblotting [6, 14]. Although neurologic involvement in Lyme borreliosis is classically seen after several weeks to months of infection with B. burgdorferi [11], isolated facial palsy has been reported to occur earlier, at times concomitant with or preceding erythema migrans (EM) [5, 10]. An immunoglobulin G (IgG) immunoblot may be negative in early Lyme borreliosis [6]. We hypothesized that as facial palsy is usually an early manifestation of Lyme borreliosis, a diagnostic IgM immunoblot will be observed. Recently, an effort to improve the accuracy of serodiagnosis of Lyme borreliosis was undertaken [3]. We used the proposed IgM immunoblot criteria to confirm B. burgdorferi infection in patients with acute facial palsy.
