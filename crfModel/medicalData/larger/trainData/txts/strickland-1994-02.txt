Of the 283 patients meeting CDC's criteria for Lyme disease, 169 (59.7 percent) were reported to have EM; 65 with and 104 without arthritic, neuro- logic, or cardiac manifestations (see figure). Of the remaining 114 (40.3 percent), 101 complained of arthritic, 16 of neurologic, and 4 of cardiac symptoms without having the characteristic rash. (Although the physicians were to report only observed rashes, it was obvious that patient descriptions of prior EM influenced diagnostic decisions and were often included in the Lyme disease case report forms.)
