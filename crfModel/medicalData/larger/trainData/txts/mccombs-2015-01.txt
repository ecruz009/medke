In the late 1970s, Lyme disease was virtually unknown. Originally termed Lyme arthritis, Lyme disease was first documented when a group of children living near Lyme, Connecticut, became ill with arthritis-type symptoms. In the early 1980s, the bacterial pathogen, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto species complex, was identified as the causative agent.
