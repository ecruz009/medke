Neurological manifestations include meningitis, encephalitis, cranial neuritis ± including unilateral or bilateral facial palsy ± motor and sensory radiculoneuritis, mononeuritis multiplex, chorea and myelitis. The usual pattern consists of fluctuating symptoms of meningitis accompanied by facial nerve palsy and peripheral radiculoneuropathy [1]. In 96 children reported by Belman et al. [3] the most frequent neurological symptom was headache and the most frequent neurological sign facial palsy. Less common manifestations in children were sleep disturbances and papilloedema, with increased intracranial pressure. The latter seems to be unique to North American paediatric Lyme disease. Peripheral neuropathy and  meningoradiculitis, in contrast with adults, were rare [3].
