Currently in Canada and the United States, a two-tiered serology protocol is the only validated diagnostic approach for LD diagnosis recommended by United States CDC and the Public Health Agency of Canada [17,18]. This two-tiered test is typically an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) to detect IgM or IgG antibodies to B. burgdoferi in serum and if the sample is positive or equivocal on the screening assay, then a western blot is used to detect serum IgM or IgG antibodies to B. burgdorferi.
