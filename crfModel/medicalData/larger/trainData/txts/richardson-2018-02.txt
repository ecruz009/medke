Two recent systematic reviews focused on LD vaccines that are no longer available on the market. Zhao et al. (2017) concluded that whilst side-effects were rare, further research on efficacy and safety was needed. Badawi et al. (2017) compared monovalent vaccines (LYMErix, ImmuLyme) (neither currently available) with preliminary data for next-generation multivalent vaccines and concluded that the multivalent vaccine was slightly more tolerable than the monovalent one, which in turn was not worse than other vaccines in the USA-based Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). Despite approval for the LYMErix vaccine by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the LYMErix vaccine was voluntarily withdrawn from the market, in 2002, due to poor sales. The replacement of monovalent vaccines with vaccines that have a similar approach may, therefore, not be the best method for new vaccine development (Badawi et al., 2017). Only one review examined the effect of antibiotic prophylaxis (after a bite). In this review, Warshafsky et al. (2010) concluded that pooled data from four placebo-controlled trials supported the use of antibiotic prophylaxis in endemic areas.
