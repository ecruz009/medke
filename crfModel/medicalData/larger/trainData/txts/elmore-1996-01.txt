An additional problem is that the clinical spectrum of these patients now encompasses a more diverse number of causes other than nonpolio enteroviruses, including: (1) meningitis due to culturable pathogens in which the pathogen concentration in CSF is below the diagnostic sensitivity of standard microbiologic stains (eg, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Listeria monocytogenes, Cryptococcus neoformans) [6]; (2) meningitis due to treatable causes not culturable from CSF under routine conditions (eg, human immuno-deficiency virus [HIV], Lyme disease, syphilis); and (3)  systemic illnesses (eg, bacteremia, endocarditis, vasculitis) or parameningeal focal processes (eg, brain tumor, brain or paraspinal abscess, transverse myelitis, herpes simplex encephalitis), many of which are inherently treatable. An increasingly complex host population with an expanding array of treatable possibilities fosters confusion in management, unnecessary diagnostic testing, and misdirected expenditures.
