The vector, the tick Ixodes ricinus is present in most parts of mainland France, except above 1,200 m and in the dry Mediterranean areas [36]. Ixodes ricinus ticks, the primary vector in Europe, are usually found in vegetation types with deciduous or mixed woodland that maintain high humidity (requiring a relative humidity of at least 80%) and in areas of moderate to high rainfall, such as in eastern and central regions of mainland France [4,36-38]. Since infection is correlated with tick abundance and human to tick exposure, this variability in incidence rates could be explained by differences in geographical and climate characteristics, in types of exposure (recreational and occupational exposure to ticks and outdoor activities) and presence of competent reservoir hosts. Tick nymphs are mainly responsible for transmitting Borrelia to humans and quest most actively from spring to autumn [4,36,37]. Diagnoses of acute LB peak in summer in many northern and central countries of Europe [4]. These findings were also confirmed in our study with higher incidences of LB from July to September.
