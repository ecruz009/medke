Treatment for patients with erythema migrans typically involves oral doxycycline or amoxicillin, [5-7] and most patients treated with either of these agents for local infection have an excellent response. However, not all patients given oral antibiotics for early disease have a favorable outcome, [8,9] perhaps because the drugs have insufficient activity against borrelia in the central nervous system. [10] Ceftriaxone is highly active against B. burgdorferi and reaches high levels in the cerebrospinal fluid and synovial fluid. [10,11] Treatment with ceftriaxone is effective in acute disseminated Lyme disease, including that manifested by neuroborreliosis, carditis, and meningitis. [11-13] We conducted a study to compare the effectiveness and tolerability of parenteral ceftriaxone and standard oral therapy in patients with acute disseminated B. burgdorferi infection but without meningitis.
