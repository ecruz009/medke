Lyme disease, caused by Borrrelia burgdorferi and transmitted by the blacklegged tick, is the most common vector-borne disease in the United States (US) [Adams et al., 2016]. For persons who live in or have recently travelled to an endemic area, diagnosis can be made based on erythema migrans, the hallmark rash of early Lyme disease [Wormser et al., 2006].
