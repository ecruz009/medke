Lyme disease (LD) is the most common tick-borne infection in North America [1,2]. It was first publically recognized in the United States in 1975 in the towns of Lyme and Old Lyme Connecticut as a result of an investigation into 51 cases (39 children) with a similar form of arthritis, although the first case was describe five years earlier by a dermatologist in Wisconsin [3,4]. In North America early signs of infection may include erythema migrans (EM, a characteristic skin rash that often has a bulls eye appearance) and fever and non-specific symptoms like headache and lethargy [5,6]. If untreated, the disease can progress to disseminated LD with neurological, cardiac and arthritic manifestations [7]. Lyme disease in North America is caused by Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto (hereafter called B. burgdorferi) and recently Borrelia mayonii was identified and may be responsible for a proportion of cases, however the performance of LD diagnostic tests to identify B. mayonii infection is not available [8]. In Europe B. afzelii, B. garinii, B. burgdorferi, B. spielmanii, B. bissettii and B. bavariensis cause disease with a wider variety of symptoms than reported in North America; a number of genospecies including B garinii occur in Asia.
