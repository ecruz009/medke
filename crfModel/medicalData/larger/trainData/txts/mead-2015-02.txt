As shown for the years 2010 to 2013, Lyme disease incidence is bimodal with respect to age, with highest rates among children aged 5 to 15 years and adults older than 50 years (Fig. 5). In the United States, the incidence is higher among males in all age groups. In contrast, females account for 51% to 60% of identified cases in many European series, yielding an incidence higher than males in at least some series. [28,61,86,87] Although these patterns likely reflect behavior-related differences in exposure across populations, age and sex-specific differences in susceptibility and care-seeking behavior may also contribute. Over time, the US incidence has increased disproportionately among males, shifting the overall sex ratio from 51% male in 1992 to 53% male in 2006. [28] This sex-specific increase has been most pronounced among children. In a separate analysis of US data for 2001 to 2002, age and sex distribution were found to vary among cases reported in endemic and nonendemic areas. [88] In 12 high-incidence states, the modal age for cases was 6 years, and 54% were among males. In contrast, in nonendemic states, the modal age was 44 years, and 47% were among males. Barring fundamental differences in risk factors for infection, this discrepancy suggests misclassification (ie, that a substantial proportion of illnesses reported in nonendemic areas are actually caused by other conditions). This finding is consistent with a higher risk of misdiagnosis in nonendemic areas, a consequence of the effect of prior probability on the predictive value of clinical and laboratory findings. [89]
