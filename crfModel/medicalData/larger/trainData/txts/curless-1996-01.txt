North American Lyme disease or borreliosis results from infection by the tick-borne spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi. The organism is uncommon in temperate climates. The geographic distribution reported by the Centers for Disease Control in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report reveals only 12 cases of Lyme disease reported in Florida as compared with 6,418 in New York and 1,478 in Connecticut by 1990 [1]. In the endemic regions, Lyme disease is often included in a differential diagnosis because of the protean clinical manifestations involving skin, heart, musculoskeletal, and nervous systems. The clinical features of Lyme neuroborreliosis (LN) have been described in previous publications [2-7]. Encephalopathy may be manifested by behavioral changes; signs and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure, including a sixth nerve palsy; and unilateral or bilateral facial paralysis, There has not been a description of intranuclear ophthalmoplegia. The case we report is unique because of the abrupt signs of brainstem dysfunction suggesting a single lesion that might have resulted from neoplasia.
