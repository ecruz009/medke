Neurologic manifestations of borreliosis are less common in children than in adults. In reports of 139 LN patients, only five were less than 18 years of age [2,3,6,11]. All five had Lyme meningitis. Three of the five also had a unilateral facial palsy. Excellent recovery followed antibiotic therapy in each case. In 46 children with Lyme arthritis, a 10 year follow-up revealed neurologic symptoms in only four [12]. The symptoms included headache and memory impairment in two, seizures in one, and optic neuropathy with myelopathy in one. The neurologic complaints in these patients began 4 to 12 years after the onset of arthritis.
