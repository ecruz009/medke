In many areas of the United States, tick bites are extremely common. B burgdorferi is endemic in New England, the mid-Atlantic states, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. In these areas, the risk of infection after a prolonged bite can be high (10%-25%). [23,24] Risk of infection is much lower in the southern and western United States. Furthermore, there is no risk of transmission of B burgdorferi from an unengorged tick because the spirochetes require up to 36 hours after a bite to migrate from the tick gut to the salivary glands. [25-27] Because of these factors, routine antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended. However, if an engorged Ixodes tick has been removed from a patient in an endemic area (local rate of infection of ticks with B burgdorferi â‰¥20%), or if the tick has been attached for at least 36 hours, a single 200-mg oral dose of doxycycline can be administered within 72 hours after removal of the tick for prophylaxis against Lyme disease. [2,24] Prophylaxis is generally unnecessary after an I pacificus bite unless the local rate of infection with B burgdorferi is 20% or greater. [2]
