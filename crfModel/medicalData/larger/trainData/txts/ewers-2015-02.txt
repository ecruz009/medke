The most common manifestations of pediatric neuroborreliosis is CN VII palsy (unilateral or bilateral) and lymphocytic meningitis. Among pediatric patients with neuroborreliosis, approximately 15% will have CN VII palsy, and of those, between 30%-40% present with bilateral deficits. [2] CNs III, VI, and VIII are the next most commonly affected. Although involvement of these CNs is often diagnosed clinically, MRI has been used as a noninvasive imaging modality to confirm clinical findings. Our patient only presented with signs of right-sided CNs VII and VIII involvement on examination but was found to have inflammation of right CN III, X, and CN V bilaterally on post-gadolinium MRI without concomitant clinical manifestations. Clinically “silent” enhancement of CNs on MRI has previously been reported in pediatric cases of neuroborreliosis. Baumann et al. [3] presented a case of pediatric neuroborreliosis with only a clinically apparent, right-sided CN VI palsy despite an MRI demonstrating abnormal enhancement of CN VI bilaterally as well as CN III ipsilaterally. Silent thalamic lesions have also been reported in pediatric patients with neuroborreliosis. [4] In this case, the extent of CN inflammation even without concomitant clinical manifestations is unique within cases of North American neuroborreliosis, particularly for our patient's age group.
