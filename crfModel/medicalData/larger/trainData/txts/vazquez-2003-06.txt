As is the case with most patients with facial nerve palsy attributable to Lyme disease, all case subjectsin the study had peripheral facial nerve palsy with both the forehead and the eye affected, indicating a lesion of the lower motor neuron. Most patients had unilateral facial nerve palsy: 23 (53%) were rightsided and 19 (44%) were left-sided. One patient (2%) had bilateral facial palsy. Nine (21%) of the patients underwent a lumbar puncture, 7 of whom had a pleocytosis of the cerebrospinal fluid.
