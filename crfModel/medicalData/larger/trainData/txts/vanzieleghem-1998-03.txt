The treatment of neurological abnormalities is intravenous antibiotics (ceftriaxone, penicillin G) and steroids. Other manifestations can be treated with oral antibiotics (doxycycline, amoxicillin, cefuroxime, erythromycin). About 15% of patients experience a Herxheimer-like reaction during the first 24 h of therapy, presenting as fever, chills, myalgia, headache, tachycardia, tachypnoea and mild vasodilatation with mild hypotension. An increased circulating neutrophil count is found [1]. The weakness of both hands, arthralgia and erythema in our patient could be side effects of the antibiotics or represent a mild Herxheimer reaction.
