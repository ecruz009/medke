The underlying aetiology of LS remains unidentified; however, several possible causes have been suggested, ranging from chronic irritation to an autoimmune component, as well as infectious causes. [1] Infection with Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative organism of Lyme disease, has been proposed as a possible aetiology, due to a similarity in their histological features and the identification of Borrelia organisms in some cases of LS. [4] Evidence of this association has remained conflicting over the years, due in part to the overall lack of consistency in identifying Borrelia in many LS cases and in general. [1,5,6] Furthermore, LS does not appear to have predominantly infectious characteristics, as there has been only a single case report of LS occurring in sexual partners. [5] This does not, however, discount the possibility that LS is a reactive process occurring in Borrelia-infected skin or soft tissue. It is interesting to note that the various instances of Borrelia involvement of LS have all been reported in European cases, with no previous cases reported in the United States. [1] While spirochaetal forms have been observed histologically in US cases of LS, further identification of these organisms as Borrelia has not been demonstrated by serology, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), culture or immunohistochemistry. [7] This regional difference may be explained by the variation in the geographical distribution of different genotypic species of Borrelia, with disease in North America associated with a single type and European cases being linked to multiple genetically distinct strains.
