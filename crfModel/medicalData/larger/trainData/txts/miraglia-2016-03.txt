Lyme disease, also known as Lyme borreliosis, is the most common tick-borne infection in North America. [5] It is caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi. The disease is endemic in the Northeast, mid-Atlantic, upper Midwest, and the West Coast in northern California and Oregon. The arthropod vector in the Northeast, mid-Atlantic, and upper Midwest is Ixodes scapularis (blacklegged or deer tick), and on the West Coast, Ixodes pacificus. [6] Lyme borreliosis is also endemic in Europe and Asia, although the arthropod vector and etiologic agents differ (Table 1).
