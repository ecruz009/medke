The primary problem was the right shoulder pain with overhead activity and sleeping on his right side. From the patient’s history and systems review, the potential differential diagnoses included right shoulder subacromial impingement due to subacromial bursitis, rotator cuff tendinopathy, or a partial tear of the supraspinatus tendon. [1,2] The radiologist’s interpretation of the radiographs and MRI appeared to support subacromial impingement due to supraspinatus tendinopathy. The evaluating physical therapist determined the patient needed a range-of-motion and strength examination, posture analysis, and special tests to differentiate among the potential diagnoses. From the patient’s history and following examination, a musculoskeletal diagnosis was differentiated, but unusual and atypical symptoms began to present during the intervention. The treating physical therapist’s ability to recognize this patient’s atypical symptoms and need for another referral contribute to the importance of presenting this case report.
