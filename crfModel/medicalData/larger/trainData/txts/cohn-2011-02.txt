Early identification of those children at low risk for Lyme meningitis would allow for outpatient management while awaiting Lyme serology results. Previous studies identify clinical and laboratory differences between children with Lyme meningitis versus other forms of aseptic meningitis. [9–11] However, these single-center studies were limited by small sample size and lacked validation. In a larger retrospective cohort of 175 children evaluated for Lyme meningitis, Avery et al [12] derived a Lyme meningitis clinical prediction rule based on these 3 factors: duration of headache, presence of cranial neuritis, and percentage of CSF mononuclear cells. In a prospective cohort of 50 children evaluated for Lyme meningitis, the Avery model performed well. [13] These investigators suggested a simplification of the more complicated Avery regression equation termed the “Rule of 79s.” [13] Children who met all of the following 3 criteria were classified as low risk for Lyme meningitis: <7 days of headache, <70% CSF mononuclear cells, and absence of seventh (or other) cranial nerve palsy.
