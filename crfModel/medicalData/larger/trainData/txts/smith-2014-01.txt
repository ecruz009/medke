Lichen sclerosus (LS) is a chronic mucocutaneous inflammatory disorder that most commonly affects the anogenital skin and occurs more frequently in females than in males. [1] Clinically, it presents as white, sometimes painful, pruritic papules or plaques. Despite its predilection for the anogenital regions the condition can occur throughout the body, although lesions of the oral mucosa are exceedingly rare and those involving the gingiva are even more so. [2,3] In the oral mucosa LS is seen typically in middle-aged females, the most common sites being the lower lip, buccal mucosa and upper lip. [2] An increased risk of genital squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) has been documented in genital LS, thus resulting in an increased need for close follow-up and management of affected patients. [1,2] Malignancy involving oral cases of LS, however, has not been reported. [2] First-line treatment of LS typically involves the use of topical corticosteroids; nevertheless, the condition is not cured and remissions do not usually occur. [1]
