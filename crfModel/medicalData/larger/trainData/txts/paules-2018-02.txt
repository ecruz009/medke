Patterns of spirochete enzootic transmission are geographically influenced and involve both smallmammal reservoir hosts, such as white-footed mice, and larger animals, such as white-tailed deer, which are critical for adult tick feeding. The rising incidence and expanding distribution of Lyme disease in the United States are probably multifactorial, but increased density and range of the tick vectors play a key role. The geographic range of I. scapularis is  apparently increasing: by 2015, it had been detected in nearly 50% more U.S counties than in 1996.
