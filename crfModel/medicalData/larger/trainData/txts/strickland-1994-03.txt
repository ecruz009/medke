More than half the subjects (154 or 54.4 percent) had joint complaints. Ninety-four (33.2 percent) had only arthritis as a complaint, and arthritis occurred more frequently (odds ratio [OR] 1.6; confidence interval [CI] 0.9-2.7; P=0.09) in females (57 of 139 or 41.0 percent) than in males (44 of 144 or 30.6 percent). Neurological abnormalities were present in 27 subjects and included a combination of the following: 17 had facial palsy; 7, lymphocytic meningitis; 6, peripheral radiculitis; and 2, en- cephalitis. Eleven had neurological findings in either the presence of, or documented history of, EM while 16 did not. Five also had arthritis. The most common neurological presentation was facial palsy by itself; this condition was present in 16 (8 with EM and 1 each with concomitant arthritis or EM and arthritis). Seven patients had heart block with positive serologi- cal tests for Lyme disease. Three of these also had EM, or documented EM in the past, while four had concomitant arthritis (see figure).
