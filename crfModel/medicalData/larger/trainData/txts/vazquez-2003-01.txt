Lyme disease is caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi that is transmitted to humans by Ixodes ticks. First described in Connecticut in the late 1970s by Steere et al, [1] Lyme disease is a multisystem disorder with 3 clinical stages that include dermatologic (erythema migrans), cardiac (heart block, carditis), neurologic (facial nerve palsy, meningitis, meningoencephalitis), and rheumatologic (arthritis) symptoms.
