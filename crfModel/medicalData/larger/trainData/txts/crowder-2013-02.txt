Limitations of this study are primarily related to the response rate of the survey (15%). Due to the low number of published studies of public health faculties using internet based surveys, it is unclear if this is an acceptable response rate or how it compares to other unpublished studies of this population. It is hypothesized that respondents may have been more likely to have an interest or personal experience with Lyme disease, meaning that their answers may not be representative of others in the field. Nevertheless, few of the respondents reported working in the field or having PTLDS themselves. There are many schools of public health located in the northeastern US, however schools in Lyme endemic states represent only 30% of all schools surveyed and 40% of all emails sent were to schools in endemic states. An equal number of respondents from both endemic states and non-endemic states show that a greater percentage of respondents from endemic state schools responded to the survey. However, this would cause us to hypothesize that there would be an overestimation of understanding about the diseases in question, an overestimate of teaching rates, and more personal and professional experience. Despite the higher response rates from those in the endemic states, the data still show much uncertainty.
