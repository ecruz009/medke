B. burgdorferi (ATCC B31), grown to late log phase at 338C in BSK-H medium (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.), was used as a Lyme antigen source. Spirochetes were electrophoresed on 10% polyacrylamide gels by using the discontinuous buffer system of Laemmli and Fayre (12). Separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose by means of a Nova blot semidry transfer system (Pharmacia, Piscataway, N.J.). Following transfer, the nitrocellulose membranes were blocked by overnight incubation at 48C with 0.5% bovine serum albumin in PBS. Membranes were next cut into strips, dried, and stored desiccated until needed.
Sera were tested for IgG and IgM antibodies to B. burgdorferi antigens by incubating rehydrated strips with a 1:100 dilution of test serum in 1% nonfat milk containing PBS for 1 h at room temperature. The strips were then washed three times and a 1:1,000 dilution of biotinylated antiserum (goat anti-human IgG Î³ chain specific or IgM m chain specific) was added for a 1-h incubation; incubation was followed by three washes. Peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (diluted 1:1,000) was then added, and the mixture was allowed to incubate for 1 h at room temperature. The strips were then washed as before and 2 ml of substrate solution (4-chloro-1-naphthol) was added. After a final wash in distilled water, the strips were dried and evaluated for reactivity by comparison with controls.
