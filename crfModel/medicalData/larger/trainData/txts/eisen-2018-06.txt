Potential future magic bullet solutions, capable of both ensuring that the bite of an infected tick does not result in illness and having the potential to rapidly and dramatically reduce I. scapularis-borne human infections at the population level, include (i) human vaccines or prophylactic antibody treatments against Lyme disease spirochetes or other I. scapularis-borne pathogens [104,105,109,110], and (ii) transmission-blocking anti-tick vaccines for human use with potential for simultaneous protection against multiple I. scapularis-borne pathogens [111â€“115]. These approaches would not require daily action and vigilance, and they would be effective regardless of whether or not bites by infected ticks are noticed. If proven to be safe, effective, and acceptable for widespread use, there is no question that the re-emergence of a human vaccine against Bo. burgdorferi, or the emergence of a prophylactic antibody treatment, would be the most effective ways to rapidly reduce Lyme disease cases. However, neither approach would address the remaining I. scapularis-borne pathogens, several of which are on the rise (Figure 4). A transmission-blocking anti-tick vaccine could potentially address that shortcoming, but only if it proves to act quickly and effectively enough on an infected tick to prevent or substantially reduce the likelihood of pathogen transmission occurring before the tick is incapacitated. These urgently needed approaches merit greater resources to expeditiously move them forward in a pipeline from prevention concept to proven solution and become, should they be successful, cornerstones in public health programs to reduce I. scapularis-borne infections.
