Cranial neuropathies appear in early neuroborreliosis in about 60% of patients and develop in 45% of patients in late neuroborreliosis. [6] In addition, up to 55% of pediatric patients with neuroborreliosis can have FP. [7] FP accounts for 70% to 80% of all cranial nerve neuropathies in early LB [6] and for about one third of the cases in late LB. [8]
