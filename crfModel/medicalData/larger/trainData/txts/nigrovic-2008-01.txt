Acquired unilateral facial weakness is most commonly because of paralysis of the peripheral facial nerve. Central causes, although rare in children, must be considered when a patient presents with sparing of the forehead musculature. [1] Historically, the most commonly identified cause of an acquired peripheral facial palsy in children has been otitis media (often without mastoiditis). [2] However, over the past several decades the prevalence of Borrelia burgdorferi infections has increased significantly. [3] In endemic areas, such as the Northeastern United States, Lyme disease has become the most commonly identified cause of acquired facial palsy, [2, 4, 5, 6, 7] especially among children. [8]
