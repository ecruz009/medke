Patients were considered to have LM if the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination showed .8 white blood cells per cubic millimeter (nontraumatic tap) and they had erythema migrans (EM) and/or positive Lyme serology. Serologic tests for Borrelia burgdorferi were performed in our laboratory by previously described techniques, [5] although some patients had tests performed by offsite commercial laboratories. A positive western blot test (by laboratory-determined criteria,5 because most cases occurred before standardized western blot interpretive criteria [6]) was considered to be evidence of Lyme disease. In cases where western blotting was not performed, the enzyme immunoassays were considered true positives if the results were greater than twice the lower limit of a reactive result. VM was identified by using the same CSF criteria, in addition to laboratory confirmation of viral infection (ie, positive CSF, nasopharyngeal, or rectal cultures [poliovirus in rectal cultures was considered to be vaccine related and not causal for meningitis]).
