Cranial neuropathy is the most frequent objective neurological sign in Lyme neuroborreliosis and has been found in 47%-82% of patients with early neurological involvement [1]. Although Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato may affect most cranial nerves, facial nerve paresis is the most common manifestation of infection. Unilateral or bilateral facial palsy has been described in 72%-92% of patients with cranial nerve affection [1,2]. In previous Scandinavian studies of patients with Lyme neuroborreliosis, facial palsy was seen in 35%-51% of the cases [3,4]. Lyme disease-associated facial weakness is often rapid in onset and is frequently accompanied by painful meningoradiculoneuritis, earlier described as Garin-Bujadoux-Bannwarth's syndrome [1]. Facial palsy in Lyme disease has often been viewed as a peripheral neuropathy, although most patients have CSF abnormalities with lymphocytic pleocytosis and an increased number of plasma cells, increased CSF protein concentrations indicating blood-CSF barrier damage, intrathecal Ig production, and increased levels of a CSF glial protein marker (glial fibrillary acidic protein)  [5]. These findings imply that the brain parenchyma is likely to be involved even in early Lyme neuroborreliosis.
