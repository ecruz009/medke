Bell’s palsy represents an idiopathic, unilateral facial paralysis with an annual incidence of approximately 15 per 100,000. [1] It remains the most common cause of unilateral facial paralysis, affecting men and women equally, and although the median age at onset is 40 years, it can occur at any age. [2] Patients with Bell’s palsy commonly present with partial or complete weakness of the muscles of half of the face, resulting in an inability to raise eyebrows, wrinkle the forehead, or close the eyelid; loss of the nasolabial fold; and drooping of the angle of the mouth. Other associated symptoms include alterations in taste, hyperacusis, inability to produce tears, and a subjective feeling of facial numbness, though objective sensation is preserved.
The pathophysiology of Bell’s palsy involves inflammation of the facial nerve at the geniculate ganglion, causing compression and associated ischemia or demyelination. [3] Symptoms are often acute and progressive, evolving during 1 day to 1 week. It has been postulated that the herpes simplex virus type 1 may play a causative role, though this theory is still in question. [4] If left untreated, approximately 85% of patients with Bell’s palsy will experience some recovery, [5] and treatment with corticosteroids, with or without antiviral medications, has been shown to improve outcomes.
